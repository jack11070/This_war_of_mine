DailyLog/IntroTitle	We've found a shelter.
DailyLog/IntroMessage	War has driven us from our homes and took everything away. Fleeing the slaughter, we meet by chance, taking shelter in this battered building.
DailyLog/IntroMessageThieves	Many people living in the capital did not believe that the war would affect them. But it did. The military cut off the city from the outside world. Hunger and disease are widespread. There is no running water. Sniper bullets and mortar shells are a constant threat.

Marin lost everything in a fire. Arica fled to Pogoren following the massacre of her town, only to find the city besieged. Katia, who came here to report from the war zone, befriended them in the queue at the water pump. With nowhere to stay, they decided to make a ruined building their temporary home. They also took in Misha, a small boy who got separated from his parents in the chaos of the evacuation.
DailyLog/IntroMessageOrdinaryPeople	War has been raging for countless months and the besieged city has been reduced to a sea of ruins by constant shelling. Going outside during daylight is like inviting snipers to target practice. Everything is in short supply and what little aid reaches the city is seized by the most ruthless and best armed.

Few residents were lucky enough to flee. The unlucky ones, like Zlata, Cveta, Anton and Pavle, who missed the last refugee convoy, are left to fend for themselves. Ordinary people with no survival skills, huddling in the ruins, relying only on each other to survive.

Few residents were lucky enough to flee. The unlucky ones, who missed the last refugee convoy, are left to fend for themselves. Ordinary people, huddling in the ruins, relying only on each other to survive.
DailyLog/IntroMessageBandits	Surrounded in the capital by the government military, the rebels refuse to surrender. Caught in the middle of the fighting, with no running water or phones, struggling with lack of food and medications are civilians. In a civil war everyone is affected, one way or another.

Roman used to fight for the rebels, but he became disillusioned and ran away. Arica came to the capital fleeing persecutions in her home town. Bruno has been cut off by the siege from his home and his dearest friend. Homeless, on the run, and with nothing to lose but their lives, they band together to survive.
DailyLog/IntoMessageSurvivalists	How long has this siege lasted? It's hard to say when every day is a struggle for survival. The city is crawling with snipers. Shelling is ordinary business almost every night. Phones don't work, there is a shortage of food and meds, and many people are left homeless.

Bruno and Marko have always been good friends, so when the war broke out they decided to stick together. They met Pavle while scavenging for supplies. He used to be Pogoren's star football player, now he's just another homeless victim of war, so they teamed up, hoping for the best.
DailyLog/IntroMessageTraders	When the civil war broke out, many people thought it would only last a couple of weeks. It's been years since government military surrounded the rebels in the capital, cutting off all supply lines. The civilian population trapped in the city are suffering from hunger, disease, and shelling.

Katia met both Pavle and Bruno before the war. She used to be a reporter, while Bruno had his own television cooking show. Pavle was the star of the local football team. Katia even interviewed him once. Now they meet in dramatically different circumstances, looking for food and shelter.
DailyLog/CalmNightDescription	The night was calm, apart from the echo of distant shots. Let us hope it won't get worse.
DailyLog/Couple_01	The prolonged siege has turned many neighborhoods into mountains of rubble. Survivors fled to districts abandoned earlier by those who were lucky enough to have been evacuated. Huddled in partially collapsed houses full of holes, they are vulnerable to any attack - and this attracts the human vermin.

Anton and Cveta were friends back in high school, but their paths diverged after graduation. Reunited by fate after losing everything but their lives, they decide to stick together and hope that people who knew them before the war will help them survive this calamity.
DailyLog/Couple_02	This part of the besieged city has been spared from the worst destruction until recently, which attracts many homeless survivors from other neighborhoods. Smelling easy game, robbers descend on them in force to prey on their misery.

Fleeing from a thug, Katia has been saved by Roman, a former militia member. Later, her quick thinking and press badge saved them both when they stumbled upon an army picket. They decide to ride it out together despite severe differences in their views.
DailyLog/Loner_01	Affected by years of siege, the city of Pogoren is slowly dying. All the services except for electricity are gone and both food and water are scarce. Until recently, this neighborhood has been relatively intact and people still have some valuables on them. Unfortunately, this also attracts the gangs.

Firefighter Marko was fighting a losing battle with blazes until his fire station got destroyed and most of his team buddies perished. With his family safe in the countryside, he moved into an abandoned house to gather his wits and decide what to do next.
DailyLog/Loner_02	The army has surrounded the rebels in Pogoren and are now running a terror campaign, using indiscriminate shelling and sniper fire to break the defenders' will. The militias control most of the city, but in this neighborhood, full of refugees from other districts, gangs of robbers rule the streets.

Boris has lost everything that was dear to him and after being driven away by every single community he approached, came upon an abandoned house, full of holes. Figuring that a leaky roof over his head is better than no roof at all, he decided to hole up here for a while.
DailyLog/IntroMessageRomanEmilia	The misery brought by the endless siege has forced people to band together, but it has also broken up many small communities. The lonely survivors, bumping into each other by chance, often decide to ride out the war together regardless of the differences between them.

Roman was a frontline soldier, but having witnessed one execution too many, he deserted. Emilia, a lawyer, used to live with her father and sister in a posh villa. She's the only one left from her family. Content with each other's company, at least for now, they find a slightly less ruined house to hole up inside.
DailyLog/IntroMessageBuilders	Months of incessant bombardment have turned this part of town into a sea of ruins. While most of the residents have fled to seek shelter in districts less exposed to sniper fire, the abandoned tenements attract those less fortunate, who have nowhere else to hide.

Marin lost everything in a fire that destroyed his workshop. Boris and Emilia once had families and now they are both the lone survivors. They come across a house that still offers some protection from the elements and decide to weather the siege together, inside its walls.
DailyLog/IntroMessageZlataEmilia	The relentless bombardment has reduced this part of the besieged city to ruins. Snipers hunt for survivors, making daytime trips in search of water and food a deadly game. The local community responded by pulling together with stubborn perseverance. Sadly, some people turned to stealing and worse.

Zlata, a student at the music academy, lost her parents. After the evacuation of her younger brother, she took Emilia, a lone survivor, under her wing. Together, they decided to shelter in an abandoned house and hope for the best. Despite their difficult situation, they agreed to look after a young girl named Kalina, while her older brother went to seek aid outside the city.
DailyLog/IntroMessageTraders2	When the civil war broke out, many people thought it would only last a couple of weeks. It's been years since government military surrounded the rebels in the capital, cutting off all supply lines. Civilian population trapped in the city is suffering from hunger, disease, and shelling.

Katia met both Pavle and Marko before the war. She used to be a reporter, while Marko worked as a firefighter and they spoke briefly after a fire emergency. Pavle, star of the local football team, gave her an interview once. Now, they meet in dramatically different circumstances, looking for food and shelter.

Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple01/lady_01	What will be over, my dear?
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple01/man_02	The war. We spoke about this, remember?
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple01/lady_02	The war... We've lived through a war already.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple01/man_03	Of course, honey, it was long ago. We met then, remember?
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple01/lady_03	You were so handsome in your uniform! So many years...
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple01/lady_04	... but I don't trust soldiers anymore. They bring nothing but trouble!
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple01/man_04	And you shouldn't, honey. They attacked the city, I told you...
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple02/man_01	We must save food, they've cut the rations...
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple02/lady_01	Don't worry, my dear, I've already eaten.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple02/man_02	You haven't honey, not today. Don't you remember?
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple02/lady_02	Oh, you're right. I forget all the time...
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple02/man_03	I know, honey, I know...
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/OldCouple02/lady_03	Maybe we'll have a nice dinner tomorrow?
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/stolen/lady_01	I don't feel so well, my dear... I'm so weak...
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/stolen/lady_02	Could you make me supper and give me my pills...?
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/stolen/man_02	I can't, honey. Someone took most of our things yesterday...
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/stolen/man_03	Don't you remember? We were robbed last night.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/stolen/lady_03	Times like these bring out the worst in some people...
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/stolen/man_04	Indeed they do. Tomorrow I'll try to borrow some food from the neighbors.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/stolen/lady_04	You'd better do that. You look all pale and thin.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/stolen/man_05	Just stay strong, my dear. Don't worry about me.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/notstolen/man_01	I hope no one will come tonight.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/notstolen/lady_01	Why is that? You like visitors.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/notstolen/man_02	Not when they're acting strange, like the last one.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/notstolen/lady_02	Was someone here? What did they want?
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/notstolen/man_03	I don't know... A stranger was here, looking around.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/notstolen/man_04	Fortunately nothing important is missing.
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/notstolen/lady_05	People are so sad and confused lately, you know?
Dialogues/014_OldCouple/notstolen/man_05	Perhaps you're right, my dear, but we don't need more visitors like this.

Dialogues/MINI_Music/B_02	The charts? Like the top songs on the radio?
Dialogues/MINI_Music/A_03	Yeah, all the goodness of the most recent music.
Dialogues/MINI_Music/A_04	We used to bet the positions with my pal.
Dialogues/MINI_Music/B_04	For money?
Dialogues/MINI_Music/A_05	Sometimes. Recently we borrowed some old radio…
Dialogues/MINI_Music/A_06	But the batteries died before the last 5 songs.
Dialogues/MINI_Music/B_05	So much for our betting.
Dialogues/MINI_Music/A_07	Screw the betting, I wanna know what’s popular with folks outside.
Dialogues/MINI_Music/B_06	I personally don't care, unless it’s old school rock’n’roll again.
Dialogues/MINI_Music/A_08	Yeah, you just need your chicken and rock’n’roll…
Dialogues/MINI_Music/B_07	You know me.
Dialogues/015_Violator_part3/v_01	You're coming with me!
Dialogues/015_Violator_part3/v_02	Walk, you bitch, or I will shoot you.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Shelter/A_01	^CharacterName^, what do you think about this place?
Dialogues/Dwellers/Shelter/B_01	You know, proper home it ain't, but we're safe enough here...
Dialogues/Dwellers/Shelter/A_02	The shelling have ruined the whole quarter.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Shelter/B_02	Yeah, but let's hope they won't waste shells on ruins.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Shelter/A_03	You think the artillery won't hit us?
Dialogues/Dwellers/Shelter/B_03	You never know, but it's our best bet.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Snipers/A_01	^CharacterName^, you think the snipers are still around?
Dialogues/Dwellers/Snipers/B_01	Yeah, plenty of them in the city.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Snipers/A_02	The military has been pushing really hard lately.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Snipers/B_02	That's true, going out in the daylight is like playing Russian roulette.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Snipers/A_03	Good thing we can get around at night.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Snipers/B_03	It's much safer. These bastards still don't have the night scopes.
Dialogues/Dwellers/Snipers/A_04	Quantity over quality...
Dialogues/Dwellers/WarEnd/A_01	You think it will be really over?
Dialogues/Dwellers/WarEnd/B_01	I don't know, ^CharacterName^, I hope so.
Dialogues/Dwellers/WarEnd/A_02	But it's getting harder each day, with even more shelling and fewer supplies...
Dialogues/Dwellers/WarEnd/B_02	The army wants to win the war before other countries get involved.
Dialogues/Dwellers/WarEnd/A_03	But so do the rebels.
Dialogues/Dwellers/WarEnd/B_03	If only they'd just leave us alone...
Dialogues/Dwellers_Busy/VariantA/A_01	^CharacterName^...
Dialogues/Dwellers_Busy/VariantA/B_01	Sorry, I'm busy...
Dialogues/Dwellers_Busy/VariantB/A_01	Got a minute?
Dialogues/Dwellers_Busy/VariantB/B_01	Can it wait? I'm doing something.
Dialogues/Conversations/01/Speaker1_01	I heard that the siege will end soon.
Dialogues/Conversations/01/Speaker2_02	I hope not. I know a rich place that hasn't been robbed yet.
Dialogues/Conversations/01/Speaker1_02	So, maybe tomorrow?
Dialogues/Conversations/02/Speaker1_01	I met a nice girl last night.
Dialogues/Conversations/02/Speaker2_01	Did she give you head?
Dialogues/Conversations/02/Speaker1_02	Yup!
Dialogues/Conversations/03/Speaker1_01	We have to get some more water.
Dialogues/Conversations/03/Speaker2_01	To make more moonshine?
Dialogues/Conversations/03/Speaker1_02	To drink, fool.
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_01/Speaker1_01	Too bad our hostage died.
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_01/Speaker2_02	We should've given him some food.
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_01/Speaker1_02	Yeah, we'll have to remember to do this next time.
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_02/Speaker1_01	What about the ransom?
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_02/Speaker2_02	We'll still demand it, they don't know he's dead.
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_02/Speaker1_02	And after they've paid, we'll just give them the body?
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_02/Speaker2_03	Exactly.
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_03/Speaker1_01	The last one also died?
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_03/Speaker2_01	No, no one paid the ransom for him.
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_03/Speaker1_02	You killed him?
Dialogues/Conversations/009_Soldiers_03/Speaker2_02	No, he fled.
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/01/n_01	How are you feeling, {mr|sir}{fr|ma'am}?
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/01/p_01	It's getting better.
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/01/n_02	I'm glad to hear that.
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/02/n_01	{mr|Sir}{fr|Ma'am}? is everything all right?
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/02/p_01	The pain subsided, but I'm worried that the hospital will take another bombing.
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/02/n_02	Try not to think about it. Just focus on getting better.
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/03/p_01	Good to see you, nurse.
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/03/n_01	Do you need something, {mr|sir}{fr|ma'am}?
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/03/p_02	Not really, I feel better just looking at you.
Dialogues/018_hospital_patient_nurse/03/n_02	Oh, I'm glad you're in a good mood.
Dialogues/017_Priest/Priest_01	Welcome, we have been robbed recently, so we have little left...
Dialogues/017_Priest/Priest_03	My flock sleeps beneath the church. Please do not disturb them.
Dialogues/017_Bandit01/Bandit01_01	Hmm, there should be some ammo left here somewhere.
Dialogues/017_Bandit01/Bandit01_02	Ah, here it is!
Dialogues/017_Bandit01/Bandit01_03	Getting rid of that priest took more than I'd expected.
Dialogues/017_Bandit01/Bandit01_04	I think that's all. I'd better be going back.
Dialogues/017_Bandit01/Bandit01_05	Am I being followed?
Dialogues/017_Bandit01/Bandit01_06	Get a grip man, nobody's here.
Dialogues/017_Bandit02/Bandit02_01	Time for a cigarette break.
Dialogues/017_Bandit02/Bandit02_02	The wind is blowing this damn smoke from the church in our direction.
Dialogues/017_Bandit02/Bandit02_03	Why did those fools set it on fire? We're bound to get sick!
Dialogues/017_Girl/Girl_01	I tremble whenever I think of those bandits.
Dialogues/017_Girl/Girl_02	I hope they won't come back.
Dialogues/017_Scavenger/Scavenger_01	Ok, I'm out of here.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_01/Caregiver_01	^CharacterName^, you can't give up!
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_01/Caregiver_02	It's hard, but we are in it together!
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_01/LookedAfter_01	I... I know. But all this...
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_01/LookedAfter_02	It's too much for me...
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_01/Caregiver_03	Yeah, things look grim...
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_01/Caregiver_04	...but I'm here for you if you need me.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_01/LookedAfter_03	Thank you. You're a good friend.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_01	^CharacterName^... You know you're not alone in this.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_01	Yeah... I just...
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_02	I don't think we'll make it.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_02	If we are to make it...
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_03	...we must help each other, right?
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_03	...yeah.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_04	This means we'll be needing you, ^CharacterName^.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_04	Sorry. You're right.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_05	I'll try to pull myself together.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_01/Caregiver_01	Please, ^CharacterName^...
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_01/Caregiver_02	...don't give up.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_01/LookedAfter_01	It's so hard... to keep going...
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_01/Caregiver_03	I know. I know.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_01/Caregiver_04	But we have to go on.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_01/LookedAfter_02	It's hopeless. But... I'll do what I can.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_01/Caregiver_01	I know you're suffering, ^CharacterName^.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_01/Caregiver_02	I'd do anything to help you.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_01/LookedAfter_01	Thank you. Pity you can't, eh?
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_01/Caregiver_03	I just... I really wish I could.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_01/LookedAfter_02	Sorry. And thank you. Really.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_01/LookedAfter_03	Now go away.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_01/Caregiver_01	Hey ^CharacterName^, listen to me.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_01/LookedAfter_01	What do you want?
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_01/Caregiver_02	Just to remind you that you’re not alone here.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_01/LookedAfter_02	Go away…
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_01/Caregiver_03	No! I want to make it through, and I need your help...
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_01/Caregiver_04	...so stop crying and pull yourself together!
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_01	^CharacterName^, you look really sad.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_02	You wanna talk?
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_02/LookedAfter_01	No, I don’t.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_03	Ok then, we can sit together in silence.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_02/LookedAfter_02	Oh come on, I don’t need your pity.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_04	I’m not leaving you until you talk to me.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_01	Hey ^CharacterName^, sorry to bother you…
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_02	…but you can’t just sit there and cry.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_02/LookedAfter_01	That’s none of your business.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_03	I didn’t mean to offend you…
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_04	…but you mustn’t give up.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_02/LookedAfter_02	Don’t tell me what I must or mustn’t do!
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_05	Quit it! We have to help each other to survive!
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_01	^CharacterName^, I can see you’re down…
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_02	…but we need to work together to make it.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_01	I doubt we’ll make it…
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_03	We won’t, if you don’t help. Come on! Get a grip!
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_02	I’ll try.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_04	Trying’s not good enough.
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_03	Alright, stop pestering me already!
Dialogues/DwellerComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_04	What do you want me to do?
SpeechesCasual/DayOne/00	It seems quite safe here...
SpeechesCasual/DayOne/02	We'd better stay inside during daylight.
SpeechesCasual/DayOne/03	Let's see if there's anything useful left here.
SpeechesCasual/DayOne/04	A few improvements and it can be livable.
SpeechesCasual/DayOne/05	Someone should search for supplies at night.
SpeechesCasual/DayOne/06	With proper tools we could build the stuff we need.
SpeechesCasual/DayTwoThree/01	There's nothing more to tear down in the district, so the military lost interest.
SpeechesCasual/DayTwoThree/06	People got nervous and suspicious. Better not provoke them.
SpeechesCasual/DayTwoThree/07	I heard about aggressive groups wandering in this area.
SpeechesCasual/DayTwoThree/08	The snipers can still be around.
SpeechesCasual/DayTwoThree/09	There's never enough food, medication and bandages.
SpeechesCasual/DayTwoThree/10	Simple disease will kill you in a few days without medicine.
SpeechesCasual/DayTwoThree/11	There's plenty of materials around, we could build something useful.
SpeechesCasual/GuestAtDoor/00	Someone's at the door.
SpeechesCasual/GuestAtDoor/01	Was someone knocking?
SpeechesCasual/GuestAtDoor/02	I heard someone outside. Should we let him in?
SpeechesCasual/GuestAtDoor/03	There's someone waiting outside.
SpeechesCasual/DialogueAttempt/00	Oh, I see you're busy...
SpeechesCasual/DialogueAttempt/01	You're doing something? I won't bother you now.
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayOne/00	You must've gone through a lot...
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayOne/01	What can I do to help?
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayOne/02	It's good not to be alone anymore.
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayOne/03	I'm glad you invited me to stay.
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayOne/04	I like what you did with this place.
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayTwoThree/00	I wonder how much longer this war will last.
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayTwoThree/01	You heard what the military did in Gravia?
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayTwoThree/02	I wonder who is worse... rebels, or the military?
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayTwoThree/03	We'd better avoid anyone armed, regardless who they are...
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayTwoThree/04	Will we be able to return to our normal lives after all this?
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayTwoThree/05	I'd love a cup of hot coffee...
SpeechesCasual/AcceptedDweller/DayTwoThree/06	Families torn apart by war... such a sad sight.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/seeDoors/00	Hey! Can you help me?!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/seeDoors/01	Hey, people! I need to talk to you!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/seeDoors/02	Can you open the door, please? I have no bad intentions!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/seeDoors/03	Hey, anybody there? I want to talk to you!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/gettingBored/00	Let me in, please!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/gettingBored/01	I'm just looking for shelter, have a heart!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/gettingBored/02	At least hear me out!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/isInside/00	Do you need an extra pair of hands here?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/isInside/01	I can be useful, let me stay with you.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/isInside/02	We have better chances together, can I stay?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/isInside/03	Can I stay here with you? I have nowhere to go...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/isInside/04	I have no home left... Maybe I could stay with you here?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/leaving/00	Alright, I'm out of here.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/leaving/01	If you think you're better off without me...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/leaving/02	Maybe I'll have better luck elsewhere...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/leaving/03	Suit yourself. I'm probably better off without you anyway.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/leaving/04	You're leaving me out here to die...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/accepted/00	You won't regret this!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/accepted/01	Thank you! Together we can make it.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/accepted/02	Good decision. Just tell me what to do.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/accepted/03	You don't know how grateful I am.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/accepted/04	Good to find some friendly people at last!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/mustWait/00	Please, make up your mind.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/mustWait/01	So, what will it be?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/mustWait/02	Have you decided yet?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/rejectedAreYouSure/01	Maybe you can think this through?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/rejectedAreYouSure/02	Come on, let me stay...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/DwellerCandidate/rejectedAreYouSure/03	Please, I beg you...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BarelySurvived/0	Bloody hell... I barely made it... Oh, screw all this!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BarelySurvived/1	Oh, damn, it hurts so much... it's hell out there. Don't ask me...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BarelySurvived/2	Oh... Just... leave me alone...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHard/0	I made it... help me, I'm barely standing...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHard/1	I'm back... but I need help. It hurts...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHard/2	Ah... damn, I can't take it anymore... help!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackSlightlyWounded/0	I made it with just a few scratches.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackSlightlyWounded/1	A few cuts and bruises couldn't have stopped me from getting back to you.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackSlightlyWounded/2	Oh, it's good to be back... I'm a bit battered, but it could've been worse.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackSafeAndHealthy/0	Hi, I'm back! And in one piece, if a bit tired.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackSafeAndHealthy/1	I made it without a single scratch!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackSafeAndHealthy/2	It's good to be back alive and well!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotBandagesWithAGreatEffort/0	Here, the bandages... Don't ask me.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotBandagesWithAGreatEffort/1	I've got the bandages... I... don't want to talk about it.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotBandagesWithAGreatEffort/2	I brought the bandages. Now leave me alone.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotMedsWithAGreatEffort/0	I have the meds... You don't want to know what it took to get them.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotMedsWithAGreatEffort/1	Here, your meds. I hope they are worth it...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotMedsWithAGreatEffort/2	I made it, I brought the meds... and just leave it at that.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHardButGotBandages/0	I've got the bandages... and now I'm gonna need them too.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHardButGotBandages/1	I made it, I got the bandages! And I need them too, isn't luck a bitch?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHardButGotBandages/2	I've got the bandages! Ow. Sorry, it looks like I could use some, too.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHardButGotMeds/0	Hey, I got the meds!... But I need some bandages to stop the bleeding.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHardButGotMeds/1	Here, I brought some meds. Now if you excuse me, I need to have this wound dressed…
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/ItWasHardButGotMeds/2	Ow. I've got the meds, but I also got roughed up... more than a bit.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/EmptyHanded/0	Sorry, I haven't found anything useful... I really tried.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/EmptyHanded/1	I got nothing. I'm so sorry to disappoint you...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/EmptyHanded/2	Sorry, no luck tonight. I'll look harder next time.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotBandages/0	I'm back, and I have the bandages!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotBandages/1	Look, I've got the bandages! Let's dress that wound...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotBandages/2	I brought the bandages! Now let's see to that wound...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotMeds/0	Look, I brought some meds!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotMeds/1	I'm back, and I've got the meds!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotMeds/2	I got the medicine. I hope it'll help...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotFood/0	Hey, I brought some food!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotFood/1	Who ordered carryout? Here you go!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/GotFood/2	Hi, I got us some chow!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackAndHappy/0	Hi, I'm back! And let me tell you, it's not all doom and gloom out there!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackAndHappy/1	Home sweet home! You know, sometimes I think the world hasn't gone to hell after all.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BackAndHappy/2	I'm back! I'd never thought I'd say so, but I really wish you all had gone with me tonight!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringALotOfStaff/0	Oh, my back. But look at all the stuff I brought!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringALotOfStaff/1	I found lots of useful things. Ah, it feels so good to finally stretch out!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringALotOfStaff/2	Ouch, I feel like a pack animal. Let's put the stuff I've found to good use!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringALotOfTreasures/0	Tonight I had a really good haul. Look what I got!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringALotOfTreasures/1	I found plenty of really fine stuff. What a night!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringALotOfTreasures/2	Hello! Look at all this stuff! I wish I could bring so much every night.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringSomethingSpecial/0	This was one lucky night, you won't believe what I've found!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringSomethingSpecial/1	I've struck gold tonight, look what I brought!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/BackFromScavenge/BringSomethingSpecial/2	I'm back and I feel like Santa. Just look at that!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Coffee/Available/00	This should wake me up.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Coffee/Available/01	I love the smell of coffee in the morning.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Coffee/Available/02	I'm glad we've got coffee.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Coffee/Unavailable/00	I wish I had some coffee.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Coffee/Unavailable/01	Damn it! No coffee for me.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Coffee/Unavailable/02	Too bad there's no coffee.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Cigarettes/Available/00	A smoke calms me down.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Cigarettes/Available/01	This smoke is what I need.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Cigarettes/Available/02	At least we've got some cigarettes.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Cigarettes/Unavailable/00	Where are my cigarettes?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Cigarettes/Unavailable/01	Damn it, there are no smokes left.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Cigarettes/Unavailable/02	Too bad we've run out of cigarettes.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/Idle/00	Who's gonna drink with me?
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/Idle/01	I'm... I'm dizzy...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/Idle/02	... And she's... a stairway to... hell...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/Idle/03	We're invincible, I tell you! We just need to worry less.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/Idle/04	Somewhere... over... the rainbow... painted black...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/Idle/05	You're my best friends... lemme give you a hug!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/Idle/06	I was thinking about this... and I don't know what to think...
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/DrunkActions/OutOfHome/00	I'll kill those snipers myself!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/DrunkActions/OutOfHome/01	Come here and get me!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/DrunkActions/OutOfHome/02	Retribution will come, you'll see! Just you wait!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/DrunkActions/ActionRejection/00	Nope, I'm not in the mood for that.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/DrunkActions/ActionRejection/01	I'd rather go back to that bottle.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/DrunkActions/ActionRejection/02	Surely there's something more interesting to do.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/Drugs/Drunk/DrunkActions/ActionRejection/03	Honestly... I'm just too wasted.
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/Thanks/00	Thank you!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/Thanks/01	That is very kind of you!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/Thanks/02	Thanks a lot!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/HereYouAre/00	Here you are!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/HereYouAre/01	I hope this will help!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/HereYouAre/02	Sure, take this!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/LetsGo/00	Let's go!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/LetsGo/01	Let's not waste time!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/LetsGo/02	Lead the way!
DwellerNPCSpeeches/VisitResponse/CantOrWontHelp/00	I can't help you, sorry.

StateSpeeches/Hungry/1/1_1	I'm hungry.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/1/1_2	My stomach is rumbling.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/1/1_3	I'd gladly eat something.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/1/1_4	We need food.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/2/2_1	I'm so hungry.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/2/2_2	I haven't eaten for days.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/2/2_3	We need to find food!
StateSpeeches/Hungry/2/2_4	I could eat anything...
StateSpeeches/Hungry/3/3_1	I'm terribly hungry!
StateSpeeches/Hungry/3/3_2	I'm starving... I must eat something...
StateSpeeches/Hungry/3/3_3	I must eat, I'm getting weaker.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/3/3_4	I've been starving for too long.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/4/4_1	I need something to eat... anything...
StateSpeeches/Hungry/4/4_2	I'm starving... so hungry...
StateSpeeches/Hungry/4/4_3	Everything's blurry... I'm so hungry...
StateSpeeches/Hungry/4/4_4	Something to eat... please...
StateSpeeches/Hungry/-1/m1_1	I'm finally full.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/-1/m1_2	If I eat more, I'll burst!
StateSpeeches/Hungry/-1/m1_3	What a feast!
StateSpeeches/Hungry/-1/m1_4	It's good to eat well once in a while.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/changes/high_to_zero	That'll do for now.
StateSpeeches/Hungry/changes/higher_to_high	I wouldn't mind another helping...
StateSpeeches/Hungry/changes/high_to_minus	Quite a feast!
StateSpeeches/Wounded/1/1_1	It hurts, but I'll manage.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/1/1_2	It's just a scratch.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/1/1_3	I'm bleeding, but just a little.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/1/1_4	It's just a flesh wound, but it hurts.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/1/1_5	I could do with some bandages.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/2/2_1	They hit me hard.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/2/2_2	If I don't dress this wound, it can get worse.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/2/2_3	I'm bleeding.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/2/2_4	I need to take care of this wound.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/2/2_5	It hurts like hell.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/3/3_1	I'm bleeding fast!...
StateSpeeches/Wounded/3/3_2	I'm losing too much blood. I need help.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/3/3_3	The wound's getting worse. Hurts a lot.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/3/3_4	I'm a bleeding mess...
StateSpeeches/Wounded/4/4_1	Blood everywhere... I won't make it...
StateSpeeches/Wounded/4/4_2	So much blood... Am I going to die?
StateSpeeches/Wounded/4/4_3	I'm barely breathing... Is this the end?
StateSpeeches/Wounded/4/4_4	Can't stand this pain...
StateSpeeches/Wounded/4/4_5	The pain... help me, please...
StateSpeeches/Wounded/4/4_6	No... the pain's unbearable...
StateSpeeches/Wounded/changes/high_to_zero	Now it should heal.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/changes/higher_to_high	I'll have to replace these bandages, soon.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/changes/zero_to_high	I got wounded...
StateSpeeches/Wounded/changes/zero_to_higher	Damn, it hurts!
StateSpeeches/Wounded/changes/high_to_higher	If this keeps up, I'll bleed to death.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Bed/GoingTo/01	My wounds are killing me, I have to rest in bed.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Bed/GoingTo/02	It hurts, I'll go to bed for a while.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Bed/GoingTo/03	I have to lie down for a moment or my wounds will open.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Bed/Using/01	It's not very comfy but at least it hurts less.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Bed/Using/02	It could be worse, at least I have a bed to rest in.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Bed/Using/03	It would be easier to bear this pain if someone was holding my hand.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Chair/GoingTo/01	These wounds are killing me, I have to sit down.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Chair/GoingTo/02	I'll sit down for a moment, my wounds hurt.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Chair/GoingTo/03	Let me sit down for a moment, my wounds hurt.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Chair/Using/01	My wounds hurt, I'd rather lie down in bed for a while.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Chair/Using/02	It's better than standing, but a bed would be even better.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Chair/Using/03	It could be worse. At least I have a chair to sit on.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Floor/GoingTo/01	My wounds are killing me, I have to lie down on the floor.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Floor/GoingTo/02	I'll lie down for a moment somewhere.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Floor/GoingTo/03	Let me lie down somewhere for a while, my wounds hurt.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Floor/Using/01	The floor is so cold. A bed would be so much better.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Floor/Using/02	The floor is no good, I need a proper bed.
StateSpeeches/Wounded/recoveryItems/Floor/Using/03	I wish I had a proper bed.
StateSpeeches/Sick/1/1_1	I feel ill, I hope it's nothing serious.
StateSpeeches/Sick/1/1_2	I don't feel so well, I think I have shivers.
StateSpeeches/Sick/1/1_3	I don't feel too well, I think I have a fever.
StateSpeeches/Sick/1/1_4	I've got a nasty headache.
StateSpeeches/Sick/2/2_1	I am feeling lousy. And it's getting worse.
StateSpeeches/Sick/2/2_2	This fever... I feel terrible...
StateSpeeches/Sick/2/2_3	I think I'm running a fever. Gotta get some meds.
StateSpeeches/Sick/2/2_4	I'll get worse if I don't get some medicine.
StateSpeeches/Sick/2/2_5	My throat is burning.
StateSpeeches/Sick/2/2_6	My head is killing me.
StateSpeeches/Sick/3/3_1	I've been ill for too long... I'm so weak.
StateSpeeches/Sick/3/3_2	I'm all dizzy... barely standing.
StateSpeeches/Sick/3/3_3	My throat burns, my entire body tingles.
StateSpeeches/Sick/3/3_4	If I don't get a cure, I'm done.
StateSpeeches/Sick/4/4_1	So cold... the pain... I need a doctor.
StateSpeeches/Sick/4/4_2	This illness... I don't think I'm gonna make it.
StateSpeeches/Sick/4/4_3	I'm all sore... so numb...
StateSpeeches/Sick/4/4_4	Please... call the doctor...
StateSpeeches/Sick/4/4_5	This goddamn disease... Not like this. Not like this...
StateSpeeches/Sick/changes/high_to_zero	These pills are really helping! I should be well soon.
StateSpeeches/Sick/changes/higher_to_high	It's helping. I should take more soon.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Bed/GoingTo/01	I feel ill, I have to rest in bed.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Bed/GoingTo/02	I think I have a fever, I'd better hit the bed.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Bed/GoingTo/03	I feel so weak, I'd better lie in bed for a while.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Bed/Using/01	It's not very comfy, but at least I feel warmer.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Bed/Using/02	That's a little better. I wish my mother were here.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Bed/Using/03	I've slept in better beds, but this one should do in a pinch.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Chair/GoingTo/01	I feel weak, I have to sit down.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Chair/GoingTo/02	I wish we had proper beds, and maybe some hot broth.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Chair/GoingTo/03	I can't let this illness get the better of me.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Chair/Using/01	I need to lie down on a bed, I have shivers.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Chair/Using/02	I'm so weak, I need to rest in bed for a while.
StateSpeeches/Sick/recoveryItems/Chair/Using/03	I have to overcome this illness, there are still things to do.
StateSpeeches/Tired/1/1_1	I haven't slept in some time.
StateSpeeches/Tired/1/1_2	I could use some rest...
StateSpeeches/Tired/1/1_3	I should sleep off the last night.
StateSpeeches/Tired/2/2_1	Too many sleepless nights.
StateSpeeches/Tired/2/2_2	It's hard to work without rest.
StateSpeeches/Tired/2/2_3	I need some rest.
StateSpeeches/Tired/3/3_1	I'm so worn out. If I don't get some sleep...
StateSpeeches/Tired/3/3_2	I'm too tired... I might fall asleep any moment now.
StateSpeeches/Tired/3/3_3	I'm all numb and drowsy. It's becoming unbearable...
StateSpeeches/Tired/InstantSleep/00	I'll just lie down for a minute... Too tired...
StateSpeeches/Tired/InstantSleep/01	Rest... Just a little bit of rest...
StateSpeeches/Tired/InstantSleep/02	I feel dizzy and weak... Need some rest now...
StateSpeeches/BadSleep/1/1_1	Sleeping on the floor is terrible.
StateSpeeches/BadSleep/1/1_2	I'd love a good night's sleep in a proper bed.
StateSpeeches/BadSleep/1/1_3	I slept restlessly most of the time.
StateSpeeches/BadSleep/1/1_5	My back hurts from sleeping on the floor.
StateSpeeches/Cold/0/0_1	At least it's warm.
StateSpeeches/Cold/0/0_2	We're lucky it's not cold in here.
StateSpeeches/Cold/0/0_3	I hope we'll manage to keep it warm in here.
StateSpeeches/Cold/1/1_1	It's getting cold.
StateSpeeches/Cold/1/1_2	It's easier to fall ill when it's so cold.
StateSpeeches/Cold/1/1_3	It's rather chilly inside. We should think about heating.
StateSpeeches/Cold/2/2_1	It's too cold in here!
StateSpeeches/Cold/2/2_2	I'm frozen to the bones. We must get some heating quickly.
StateSpeeches/Cold/2/2_3	You're bound to get a cold in this damn chill.
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Content/00	Not a bad day.
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Content/01	We're gonna make it.
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Content/02	Things will work out, eventually.
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Content/03	At least there's some relief.
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Content/05	Good, good. Let's just keep it that way!
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Content/06	I'm sure this day will bring some good news!
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Content/07	Soon it will be over. We'll be fine!
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Content/08	At last something good happened!
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Sad/01	Not a good day...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Sad/02	Let's not lose hope...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Sad/03	It's getting worse day by day.
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Sad/04	I wish I had left the city... Damn!
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Sad/05	It's all getting too hard...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Depression/00	I can't... I give up.
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Depression/01	This will never end...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Depression/02	All this... I can't handle it anymore.
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Depression/03	I've had enough... I can't take it anymore!
StateSpeeches/Depressed/ActionInterrupt/00	Screw this...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/ActionInterrupt/01	What good will it do?...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/ActionInterrupt/02	There is no point anyway...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Broken/00	We would be better off dead...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Broken/01	I wish I had never been born!
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Broken/02	I can't take it anymore... I just can't...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Broken/03	Please, I want to wake up from this nightmare...
StateSpeeches/Depressed/Broken/04	I'd rather be dead than live another day of this hell...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Died/spectator/Sad/00	I miss ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Died/spectator/Sad/01	How will we cope without ^CharacterName^?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Died/spectator/Sad/02	I can't believe {mr|he}{fr|she}'s gone...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Died/spectator/Depression/00	^CharacterName^... How I wish you were still with us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Died/spectator/Depression/02	^CharacterName^... oh, ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Died/spectator/Depression/01	Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} have to die?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Killed/spectator/Sad/00	I can't believe ^CharacterName^ was killed...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Killed/spectator/Sad/01	They killed ^CharacterName^ like a dog...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Killed/spectator/Sad/02	I can't believe it... yesterday {mr|he}{fr|she} was with us and now...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Killed/spectator/Sad/03	To kill like that... What a waste of life...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Killed/spectator/Depression/00	I can't stop thinking about how ^CharacterName^ was killed. Soon they'll kill us all...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Killed/spectator/Depression/01	I can't get over {mr|his}{fr|her} death... Who will be next?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Killed/spectator/Depression/02	They killed ^CharacterName^…Will they kill us all?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerDied/Killed/spectator/Depression/03	Why did they have to kill ^CharacterName^?... Such a terrible waste of life...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/content/00	I did what I did. We have to be strong or we'll all die, too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/content/01	This could happen to any of us. It's war.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/sad/00	It wasn't supposed to end like that... I can't get over it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/sad/01	Those frightened eyes...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/sad/02	It's war, but... did it have to happen?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/sad/03	Did I have a choice? I can't stop thinking about it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/depression/00	I can't believe I killed like that...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/depression/01	So much death... everywhere...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/depression/02	... That's too much for me ...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/hero/depression/03	Damn! ... I can't stop thinking about what I did...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/content/00	If ^CharacterName^ killed someone, it must have been for our good.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/content/01	^CharacterName^ made a hard choice... but it's us or them all the time.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/sad/00	^CharacterName^ killed someone... damn...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/sad/01	^CharacterName^! Why...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/sad/02	Someone died... because of us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/sad/03	I don't want to think about it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/depression/00	We better keep an eye on ^CharacterName^…
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/depression/01	Why?! Why are we doing this?...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/depression/02	I can't stop thinking about what ^CharacterName^ did...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/depression/03	No more blood! ... No more!!!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/hero/content/00	It's us or them, it could have been me lying there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/hero/content/01	I can't undo what I did. We can grieve after the war, but first we have to survive it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/hero/sad/00	I wish I could undo this... but what choice did I have?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/hero/sad/01	I can't believe I did it... It all went so quickly...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/hero/sad/02	I wish I hadn't gone there... but I went... and I killed...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/hero/sad/03	Will I kill someone next time? I hope this all ends soon, one way or the other...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/hero/depression/00	When will this shit end?... I won't have another death on me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/hero/depression/01	Oh, bloody hell... This death was the last straw, I'm done...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/content/00	^CharacterName^ did what {mr|he}{fr|she} had to. It's war.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/content/01	I'm sure ^CharacterName^ wouldn't have killed anybody if there had been a way to avoid it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/sad/00	Oh, ^CharacterName^... Why did you have to do this?...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/sad/01	If we survive, ^CharacterName^ will never forget this...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/sad/02	I wish we didn't have to do this...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/sad/03	All this killing... Is it ever going to end?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/depression/00	Do we really have to kill?! Is there no other way?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/depression/01	Another death... And for what? For what?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/hero/content/00	Bloody thugs... there's one less to worry about.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/hero/content/01	Bandit scum... they would kill me like a dog, but not this time!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/hero/sad/00	I had to defend myself... but I hate what I was forced to do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/hero/sad/01	It was a close call... I could've died, too...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/hero/sad/02	I wish we wouldn't have to kill to survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/hero/sad/03	I wonder how many people he killed... I can't become like him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/hero/depression/00	Damn it! Damn them all to hell! Why can't they just let us live?...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/hero/depression/01	Bloody murderers! I can't stand it any longer...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/content/00	Well done, ^CharacterName^. One bastard less.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/content/01	^CharacterName^ did well. Those murderers have no mercy.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/sad/00	^CharacterName^ had no choice... but I wish we had.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/sad/01	These thugs brought it upon themselves... but I feel for ^CharacterName^ anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/depression/00	It's a vicious circle... They murder people, and now ^CharacterName^ killed one of them...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/depression/01	There is already so much death everywhere... and now this...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/hero/content/01	I can't believe my luck. He was a trained killer... and I won!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/hero/content/00	He brought the war to our city, and now he's dead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/hero/sad/00	Poor bastard... I wonder if he was drafted...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/hero/sad/01	I can't stop thinking about the letter his mother will get...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/hero/depression/00	He was an ordinary guy... just like us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/hero/depression/01	I bet he didn't want to be here as much as we don't...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/spectator/content/00	Good, I wish we could get back at the snipers as well.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/spectator/content/01	^CharacterName^ is amazing. One murderer less!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/spectator/sad/00	The government is turning us against each other...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/spectator/sad/01	Sending the army against your own people is a crime... but this guy had no say in it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/spectator/depression/00	What did this poor bastard do to deserve this?! He was under orders!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/spectator/depression/01	Why did ^CharacterName^ have to do this?! They didn't ask to be here!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	I'm sure ^CharacterName^ will be fine.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	I'm sure ^CharacterName^ will be all right, this wound is nothing to worry about.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Sad/00	^CharacterName^ needs to get this wound dressed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Sad/01	I'm worried about ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Sad/02	Look at ^CharacterName^. {mr|His}{fr|Her} wound doesn't look good.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Sad/03	It's too damn easy to get wounded.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Depression/00	^CharacterName^... What did they do to {mr|him}{fr|her}...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Depression/01	I wish we could help ^CharacterName^...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Depression/02	Damn it, we can't lose {mr|him}{fr|her}...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Depression/03	^CharacterName^ has lost so much blood...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWoundedRecovered/hero/Content_Cheerful/00	I feel much better today. I'll be fine.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWoundedRecovered/hero/Content_Cheerful/01	Bandages did the job.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWoundedRecovered/hero/Content_Cheerful/02	I feel fine at last.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWoundedRecovered/hero/Content_Cheerful/03	The wound finally healed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWoundedRecovered/spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	^CharacterName^ looks better today.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWoundedRecovered/spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	Good we had the bandages for {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWoundedRecovered/spectator/Content_Cheerful/02	Seems that ^CharacterName^ has recovered.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWoundedRecovered/spectator/Content_Cheerful/03	I'm so glad ^CharacterName^ feels better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Content_Cheerful/00	I'll be fine, it's just a small cough.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Content_Cheerful/01	A good night's sleep, some pills and I'll be all right.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Sad/00	It's the most unfortunate time to fall ill…
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Sad/01	Before the war, I'd have been fine in a day or two…
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Sad/02	I won't get better without medicines.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Sad/03	Damn it, I'm not getting better at all.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Depression/00	I'm sick all the time... It's too much for me, I won't get well...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Depression/01	I fear this will not end well for me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Depression/02	I hate being ill. I'm afraid I'm getting worse…
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/hero/Depression/03	I won't see the end of war...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	I'm sure ^CharacterName^ can cope with a small cough.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	It's just a cold, {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be all right.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Sad/00	^CharacterName^ doesn't look well. I wish I could just call an ambulance...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Sad/01	I'm afraid ^CharacterName^ isn't getting any better...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Sad/02	I'm worried about ^CharacterName^, just look at {mr|him}{fr|her}...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Sad/03	I wish ^CharacterName^ got better... I fear the worst.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Depression/00	We can't beat this illness... Soon all will be over...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Depression/01	It's hopeless... Without help, we can just wish for a quick end...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Depression/02	I fear that ^CharacterName^ won't make it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Depression/03	^CharacterName^ isn't going to pull through...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSicknessRecovered/hero/Content_Cheerful/00	I feel much better today. I'll be fine.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSicknessRecovered/hero/Content_Cheerful/01	The meds did the job.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSicknessRecovered/hero/Content_Cheerful/02	I feel fine at last.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSicknessRecovered/hero/Content_Cheerful/03	I'm finally in good health!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSicknessRecovered/spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	^CharacterName^ looks better today.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSicknessRecovered/spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	Good we had the meds for {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSicknessRecovered/spectator/Content_Cheerful/02	Seems that ^CharacterName^ has recovered.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSicknessRecovered/spectator/Content_Cheerful/03	I'm so glad ^CharacterName^ feels better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	We're safe here, no one can do us harm when we're inside.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	As long as we remain alert, they can't hurt us here.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Sad/00	We managed to fend off the attack, but what if the next one is stronger?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Sad/02	We drove the thugs away last time, but we won't hold them back forever...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Sad/01	We need to be on guard. I'm afraid the bandits are just testing our defenses.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Sad/03	I'm afraid we just lucked out with the last attack. What if the next gang is stronger?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Depression/00	Sooner or later the bandits will break through. What will they do to us then?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Depression/01	We can't keep them away forever… It's only a matter of time.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Depression/02	This time we managed to drive them off, but in the long run we stand no chance...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Depression/03	It's pure luck they broke off the attack. I fear that the next one will bring on our end...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	It's good we can guard this place against aggressors.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	The bandits can be fought off! Just keep alert!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Sad/00	That was close. They bring more people, and we're toast!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Sad/01	The bandits know we're here. They'll come back in force.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Sad/02	If they keep hitting us, they'll eventually wear us down...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Sad/03	I fear we won't recover before the next attack...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Depression/00	Next time they'll break through... It's pointless...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Depression/01	We won, but at what cost? This can't go on much longer...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Depression/02	This can't go on like that. They'll kill us all in the end...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Depression/03	Another attack like that and we're done for...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	The bandits are dangerous, but we can deal with them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	The bandits can be driven away if we keep guard.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Sad/00	I'm afraid we won't survive the next attack...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Sad/01	We barely survived this time. What are we going to do we do if they return?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Sad/02	Attacks like that will grind us down soon, I'm afraid...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Sad/03	Bandits will finish us if we don't do something about it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Depression/00	We'll all die... Next time the aggressors come, we're dead...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Depression/01	We have no chance... We can't stop the bandits from doing whatever they want…
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Depression/02	Bloody thugs... one by one, they'll finish us all...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Depression/03	Next time they'll take all our stuff... and our lives...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/hero/content/00	These supplies are vital to us. I had to take them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/hero/content/01	I only took what we needed the most.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/hero/sad/00	Stealing is wrong, but what was I supposed to do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/hero/sad/01	I feel bad about it, but I had to take those things.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/hero/depression/00	How wretched can we get... We must steal to survive...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/hero/depression/01	If only we could do without stealing... But we can't...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/spectator/content/00	^CharacterName^ brought some needed goods. Yes, he stole them… so what?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/spectator/content/01	Sometimes you just have to steal to survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/spectator/sad/00	I'd rather ^CharacterName^ didn't steal, but we need supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/spectator/sad/01	^CharacterName^ brought some stolen goods. I hope those people won't need them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/spectator/depression/00	It seems the war has turned us into thieves...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Small/spectator/depression/01	Not only are we poor, now we're also foul...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/hero/content/00	I had to steal these things, they'll help us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/hero/content/01	Without these goods we would not survive, I had to take them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/hero/sad/00	Poor people, I feel bad about taking their things...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/hero/sad/01	Maybe I shouldn't have stolen those things...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/hero/depression/00	I hope those people will be alright, they needed these things as much as we did.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/hero/depression/01	Stealing from other poor people... What have I become?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/spectator/content/00	If ^CharacterName^ hadn't taken those things, soldiers or looters would...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/spectator/content/01	I pity those people, but we needed supplies...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/spectator/sad/00	I know we need supplies, but stealing?... That's just wrong.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/spectator/sad/01	How miserable can you become? Stealing to survive...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/spectator/depression/01	^CharacterName^ should've left those people more supplies, they are in need, too!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Medium/spectator/depression/00	Seems we're no better than looters...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/hero/content/00	I'm sorry for those people, but I had no choice.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/hero/content/01	Those poor people will have a hard time now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/hero/sad/00	With so little left, those people might not survive...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/hero/sad/01	I feel bad about taking those things. How are they gonna survive now?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/hero/depression/00	I left those people with virtually nothing… They won't last for long...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/hero/depression/01	What have I done... Without the things I took they will surely die...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/spectator/content/00	We're no better than looters...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/spectator/content/01	I don't think resorting to robbery was necessary...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/spectator/sad/00	Is robbery the only way to get what we need?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/spectator/sad/01	How could ^CharacterName^ leave those people with almost nothing...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/spectator/depression/00	Are we really so desperate that we need to rob people blind?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ItemsStolen/Big/spectator/depression/01	That was cruel of ^CharacterName^ to leave those people with nothing...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/hero/sad/00	I couldn't sleep all night... I feel terrible...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/hero/sad/01	How can I sleep with all my worst fears racing through my head?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/hero/depression/00	I need sleep. Yet, whenever I close my eyes, the worst things I saw come back to haunt me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/hero/depression/01	I couldn't fall asleep, I couldn't stop thinking...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftShelter/spectator/sad/00	It will be harder without ^CharacterName^ around.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftShelter/spectator/sad/01	^CharacterName^ left us. Are we that bad?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftShelter/spectator/depression/00	Could we have done anything to make ^CharacterName^ stay?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftShelter/spectator/depression/01	^CharacterName^ lost hope that we could survive here... What if {mr|he}{fr|she} was right?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Affray/spectator/sad/00	We can't keep quarreling like that, we need to help each other.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Affray/spectator/sad/01	It's hard even without ^CharacterName^ arguing about everything.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Affray/spectator/depression/00	If we can't reach an agreement, we won't survive...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Affray/spectator/depression/01	That row last night was terrible...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Suicide/spectator/sad/00	Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} do it? There still was some hope...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Suicide/spectator/sad/01	It was terrible to find out that ^CharacterName^ had killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Suicide/spectator/depression/00	Is suicide our only way out of this hell?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Suicide/spectator/depression/01	^CharacterName^ couldn't take it anymore... Are we stronger?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Cry/spectator/sad/00	It was heartbreaking to listen to ^CharacterName^ cry all night...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Cry/spectator/sad/01	Something is really wrong with ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} sobbed violently all night.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Cry/spectator/depression/00	I was unable to make {mr|him}{fr|her} stop crying...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Cry/spectator/depression/01	Seems that ^CharacterName^ is suffering from a breakdown...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Fight/hero/sad/00	^CharacterName^ got into a fight with me last night...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Fight/hero/sad/01	^CharacterName^ beat me last night. How could {mr|he}{fr|she}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Fight/hero/depression/00	^CharacterName^ was angry last night and started beating me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Fight/hero/depression/01	How are we to fight the odds if we fight each other?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerReturned/spectator/content_cheerful/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back. I was so worried.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerReturned/spectator/content_cheerful/01	^CharacterName^ made it back. It's good to see {mr|him}{fr|her} again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerReturned/spectator/content_cheerful/02	We need ^CharacterName^, it's good {mr|he}{fr|she}'s back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerReturned/spectator/sad/00	I don't know what we'd do If we lost ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerReturned/spectator/sad/01	This time ^CharacterName^ made it back despite the risk.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerReturned/spectator/depression/01	^CharacterName^ could've got killed... what was {mr|he}{fr|she} thinking?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerReturned/spectator/depression/02	I thought ^CharacterName^ wouldn't make it back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/StimulantsShortage/CIGARETTE/hero/00	Damn, it's been several days since I last smoked.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/StimulantsShortage/CIGARETTE/hero/01	A cigarette would make me feel better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/StimulantsShortage/CIGARETTE/hero/02	When was the last time I smoked?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/StimulantsShortage/CIGARETTE/hero/03	It's been so long since I last had a cigarette.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/good_trade_hero/Content_Cheerful/00	Seems the deal I made in the garage will help these people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/good_trade_hero/Content_Cheerful/01	The deal I made in the garage should benefit these people as well.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/good_trade_spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ helped the people in the garage.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/good_trade_spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	It's good when we can help each other a little, like ^CharacterName^ with those folks from the garage.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_hero/Sad_Depression/00	I can't stop thinking about what happened in the garage...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_hero/Sad_Depression/01	The folks at the garage will manage somehow... won't they?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_hero/Sad_Depression/02	I wish I hadn't had to steal from the garage...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_hero/Sad_Depression/03	Those guys at the garage... I'll make it up to them after the war... somehow...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_spectator/Sad_Depression/00	^CharacterName^ took a lot from those men at the garage...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_spectator/Sad_Depression/01	^CharacterName^ cleaned out the garage... left them with almost nothing...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_spectator/Sad_Depression/02	It's such a shame what ^CharacterName^ did at the garage... but what can we do?...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_spectator/Sad_Depression/03	It's too bad that ^CharacterName^ stole from the garage owner... but we needed that stuff!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_hero/Content_Cheerful/00	That starving man will surely be fine now. For a couple of days at least.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_hero/Content_Cheerful/01	I'm glad I shared food with that hungry man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_hero/Content_Cheerful/02	Sharing food with that man was the least I could do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	I admire what ^CharacterName^ did in the squat.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	I admire ^CharacterName^'s compassion towards that hungry man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/02	^CharacterName^ did the right thing. We need to help other people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_hero/Sad_Depression/00	That homeless man... What could I do? We're all hungry...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_hero/Sad_Depression/01	That starving guy... I wish we had enough to share...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_hero/Sad_Depression/02	That hungry man I met... I can't get over it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_hero/Sad_Depression/03	I can't forget this homeless man... I wonder if he'll live...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_spectator/Sad_Depression/00	The man that ^CharacterName^ met... What will become of him...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_spectator/Sad_Depression/01	I fear that this starving man ^CharacterName^ met won't make it through the winter...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_spectator/Sad_Depression/02	^CharacterName^ met this homeless guy... and just left him to die...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_spectator/Sad_Depression/03	This starving man ^CharacterName^ met... but we are hungry, too...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/help_hero/Content/00	I don't know how, but I did it. I helped someone in that brothel.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/help_hero/Content/01	The brothel is still there but at least I saved someone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/help_spectator/Content/00	I don't know if ^CharacterName^ is insanely brave or just insane.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/help_spectator/Content/01	This city is not owned by gangs!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/help_spectator/Content/02	What transpired in the brothel... I'm impressed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/012_scav_domek_hotel/help_hero/Content/00	I don't know where I found that courage.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/012_scav_domek_hotel/help_hero/Content/01	That guy I helped looked terrible, but he should be better by now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/012_scav_domek_hotel/help_spectator/Content/00	^CharacterName^ stood up against criminals. Well, that's admirable.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/012_scav_domek_hotel/help_spectator/Content/01	Damn psychos. Fortunately, ^CharacterName^ was able to release that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/013_construction_site/kill_snipers_hero/Content/00	I made sure they'll never hurt anybody.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/013_construction_site/kill_snipers_hero/Content/01	By killing those two soldiers I saved many lives.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/013_construction_site/kill_snipers_spectator/Content/00	Those snipers got what they deserved.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/013_construction_site/kill_snipers_spectator/Content/01	The streets are a little bit safer with those two snipers gone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Content_Cheerful_UNUSED/00	It was a pretty good loot at that old couple's house.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Content_Cheerful_UNUSED/01	I brought a lot of stuff from that old couple's house.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Sad/00	I keep thinking about that old man and his wife.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Sad/01	I didn't leave much for those old people...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Sad/02	That old woman didn't seem well. Will she be alright?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Sad/03	What will happen to those people now...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Depression/00	That old man and his wife... I can't stop thinking about what happened there...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Depression/01	Robbing that old couple was the last straw... Can't do this anymore.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Depression/02	If that woman dies... Her husband won't survive it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_hero/Depression/03	We're all ruthless robbers now... There's no point in pretending we're not...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Content_Cheerful_UNUSED/00	^CharacterName^ brought some good stuff from that last house.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Sad/00	Are we robbing pensioners now...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Sad/01	Those people ^CharacterName^ robbed...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Sad/02	^CharacterName^ took a lot from this old couple...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Sad/03	Things are now even tougher for the old people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Depression/00	^CharacterName^ robbed an elderly couple... What's become of us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Depression/01	That old couple... How will they survive...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Depression/02	We rob people blind. The war took away our dignity.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Depression/03	We're all bandits now. I'm sick and tired of it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/spared_hero/Content_Cheerful/00	That elderly couple I met... it's really amazing how they endure.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/spared_hero/Sad_Depression_UNUSED/00	That elderly couple I met... I hope they'll manage.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/spared_spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	Amazing that this elderly couple is still holding out in their house on their own.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_hero/Content_Cheerful_UNUSED/00	Old people die, and these times are especially hard on them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_hero/Sad_Depression/00	That old man and his wife... Is it my fault?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_hero/Sad_Depression/01	These old folks... What a bloody shame...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_hero/Sad_Depression/02	People die all the time... the elderly are just first to go.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_hero/Sad_Depression/03	Those pensioners wouldn't have to die in the time of peace...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/00	Those dead people ^CharacterName^ saw... What happened to them?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/01	Those elderly people had such a nice house, and now they're dead...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/02	That elderly couple ^CharacterName^ saw... Are we the cause of their demise?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/03	These old folks... what a waste of life...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_hero/Sad/00	That girl was so scared...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_hero/Sad/01	The soldiers can't just do whatever they please!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_hero/Sad/02	Why did I go to that damn shop!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_hero/Sad/03	Could someone have helped that girl?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_hero/Depression/00	That poor girl... She must've been so frightened...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_hero/Depression/01	Military scumbags... Let them all die and rot.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_hero/Depression/02	What happened in that store... I wish I hadn't gone there...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_hero/Depression/03	Someone should have helped... No one cares anymore...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Sad/00	The girl that ^CharacterName^ told about... Poor thing...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Sad/01	The military are getting even more depraved.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Sad/02	Maybe ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have gone there?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Sad/03	Could ^CharacterName^ have helped her somehow?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Depression/00	Every night I hear someone is hurt in this damn city...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Depression/01	The military is here to torment us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Depression/02	^CharacterName^... Why did you go to that store...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Depression/03	^CharacterName^... Couldn't you do anything...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_hero/Content_Cheerful/00	That girl should be safe now. What a relief.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_hero/Content_Cheerful/01	These army goons will not push us around!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_hero/Content_Cheerful/02	Good I came in the right moment to stop that soldier.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_hero/Content_Cheerful/03	To save someone's life... It feels good.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	^CharacterName^ has courage.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	I can't believe ^CharacterName^ stood up against the military.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_spectator/Content_Cheerful/02	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ went to that shop.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_spectator/Content_Cheerful/03	That girl should be grateful to ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_hero/Sad/00	I wonder what happened to that wounded man...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_hero/Sad/01	I should've helped that wounded man...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_hero/Sad/02	Poor guy... and I left him there...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_hero/Depression/00	I left him to die... What will happen to his son...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_hero/Depression/01	Without my help he probably didn't make it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_hero/Depression/02	I should've done something...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Sad/00	The story ^CharacterName^ told only confirms how dangerous the snipers are.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Sad/01	^CharacterName^ should've done something to help that man...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Sad/02	If it had been me instead of ^CharacterName^ there, would I have helped?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Depression/00	The snipers will take us down one by one. It's only a matter of time.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Depression/01	Chances are we'll all end up like that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Depression/02	If that man died, his child most likely won't make it, either.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_hero/Content_Cheerful/00	I'm so relieved that man managed to reach his baby.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_hero/Content_Cheerful/01	I'm glad I was able to help that wounded man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_hero/Content_Cheerful/02	We have to help each other whenever we can.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/00	What happened at the Sniper Junction could've ended much worse.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/01	^CharacterName^ did the right thing.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/02	I was so relieved when I heard that ^CharacterName^ helped that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_hero/Sad_Depression/00	Poor guy... That sniper must've finished the job.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_hero/Sad_Depression/01	Poor man... No one should die bleeding alone in the street.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_hero/Sad_Depression/02	I could've ended up like that poor man...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/00	Another victim of the Sniper Junction...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/01	How many more lives will the sniper bullets take?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/02	Will the killing ever stop?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/hero/content/00	I feel sorry for the patients, but I had no choice.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/hero/content/01	The hospital will have a hard time now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/hero/sad/00	Without medicines and bandages, those people might not survive...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/hero/sad/01	I feel bad about stealing from the hospital, what will happen to the patients?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/hero/depression/00	That doctor did so much for the hospital... And I ruined it all...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/hero/depression/01	What have I done... Patients in that hospital may die because of me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/content/00	So now we're stealing from the sick and wounded.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/content/01	I don't think robbing the hospital was a necessary thing.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/sad/00	Robbing the hospital... Wasn't there no other way?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/sad/01	How could ^CharacterName^ take supplies from the hospital!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/depression/00	Stealing from the hospital... What's worse than that?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/depression/01	^CharacterName^ taking medicines and bandages... That was so low...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/hero/content/00	The doctor will save more lives thanks to my help.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/hero/content/01	The hospital can't surrender! Its patients can count on us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/hero/sad/00	I hope things I traded with the doctor are going to save someone's life.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/hero/sad/01	We don't have much, but we can still help other people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/hero/depression/00	I helped the hospital... but what are we gonna do now?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/hero/depression/01	We've given away medical supplies and they are so hard to come by...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/content/00	I'd do the same as ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/content/01	If we all pull together, the hospital will not fall!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/sad/00	Donating supplies is a good idea unless we need them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/sad/01	It's good to help, but maybe it wasn't the best moment to do so.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/depression/00	Yeah, the patients will survive... We won't, though.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/depression/01	The people in the hospital stand better chances than we do...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ is very ill... We'd better dig a grave while we still have some strength left.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	We are so miserable, we can't even help ^CharacterName^ fight the illness.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I feel so powerless... ^CharacterName^ is very ill and I can only sit and watch... Can we get the meds in time?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I'm afraid ^CharacterName^ might not make it, and I can't do anything about it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ is very ill. I'm really worried we could contract this disease.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	I hope we don't get this disease from ^CharacterName^. It's bad enough with {mr|him}{fr|her} being ill.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ is very ill. We have to get {mr|him}{fr|her} medicine somehow. If we can't buy it, maybe we could steal it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	^CharacterName^ won't make it unless we get our hands on some meds.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ is getting worse and most likely won't pull through. Too bad we can't help {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	If we don't secure more meds, we will eventually all succumb to illness like ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I'm worried about ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} is getting worse. We need to find some meds real soon.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We have to take care of each other! We must get the meds for ^CharacterName^ quickly.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Damn... I'm so ill... I need meds, and I need them now... Who the fuck took the last dose?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/01	I need meds... I don't care how you get them, just get them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	The illness is getting worse all the time... I desperately need meds... I need them more than anyone else...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	You have to get me some meds... buy them, steal them, I don't care as long as I get them...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I'm so ill... This fever is killing me... I desperately need meds...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	I'm dying from this disease... you can't let me die... you can't...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I'm very ill... I think this is it... I'll die without meds...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	I'm so ill... can you get me some meds? You need me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I feel terrible... If we don't find some meds, I will die...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	You must get me some meds or I'll die... Don't let it happen... please...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I feel so sick... I don't know if I'm gonna make it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	This might be it, my friends... Promise me you'll hang on even if I don't make it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Why is it that others have so much while we have so little?! They should share, or else!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/01	Those bastards wouldn't share with us, I had to do it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	We need supplies, I couldn't let them stand in our way.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	I'm gonna make it whatever it takes.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Luckily I wasn't caught. I can still hear my heart pounding.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	That was close. Luckily, I made it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	We are no different from others. We do what we have to in order to survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	We have to steal to survive. It's war.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I know it was wrong, but how else are we to survive?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	Does it matter how we get supplies? The important thing is that we're alive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	The fate of those men is not our concern. What's important is that we've got supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	I care about my own, those men's fate is not my problem.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	It appalls me to see what I have to do so that we can make it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	How long can we go on robbing people like that before we get caught?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	What I had to do was appalling, but it's either them or us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	I did what had to be done. Gotta take care of my own.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	We hurt others to get what we need... Are we no better than bandits?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	Is robbing people really the only way to survive? If so, we've lost our souls.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I feel terrible about robbing those men...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	I can't believe I robbed those men... What was I thinking?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Poor father and son... ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have stolen from them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Why did ^CharacterName^ do it? Wasn't there any other way?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I can't blame ^CharacterName^ for stealing from the garage. I'd have done the same.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Will they be able to replace what ^CharacterName^ took from them?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	The men from the garage have it as hard as we do, I feel bad that ^CharacterName^ stole from them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/GoodTrade/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	That was a good trade, we helped each other out.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/GoodTrade/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	I'm glad we could trade with those men. We could do it again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/GoodTrade/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm so glad I could help that man's father.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/GoodTrade/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	It's good to know that despite the hardships we can still help other people!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	I saw those old people dead. Fuck this war.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/01	Fuck this war! It forces us to do such hideous things.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Old people die all the time, it is no different in war.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Those old people wouldn't have made it, even if we hadn't paid them a visit.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Those old people are both dead. Still, better that it happened to them than to us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	Those old people were defenseless. We must make sure we're not, if we don't want to end up like them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	The old couple are dead. If we hadn't taken their things, someone else would.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	Those elderly people would've died anyway, their supplies serve us better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	That poor elderly couple didn't make it and it's all our fault.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	If not for us, those old people might still be alive. I'm ashamed, but how are we to survive without food and medications?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	They're dead, we're alive. Better than the other way around. They were old anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	We care about our own. The family of those elderly people should've taken better care about them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I saw the bodies of those old people. Seems their family did not care about them after all.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	I hope we don't end up like those elderly people. Would anyone miss us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	We could've shown mercy to those old people. We didn't and now they're dead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	We caused the death of those elderly people. But if it's a choice between some stranger's life and your friend's...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Our actions led to the death of those elderly people. What excuse have we got?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	We're the reason those old people are dead. We're despicable.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	We're responsible for the death of that elderly couple. We're disgusting.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	How low can we get... It's because of us that those elderly people are dead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Those old people are dead. We are to blame.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	Robbing defenseless elderly people... We don't deserve to survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	If it hadn't been for us, that elderly couple would still be alive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I feel bad about those elderly people. They died because of us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	If we hadn't visited those old people, it could be us lying dead right now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	Those old people could not defend themselves against us. Can we defend ourselves against other looters?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We should stick together to weather this storm rather than hurt others and steal from them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/SeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	If this siege continues, everyone will die of hunger and disease, or we'll just kill each other fighting over scraps that are left.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	They were old anyway, we needed these things more than they did.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	I had no choice, I had to take their things. How else are we to survive?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	They are old and probably won't live long anyway. Their things will help us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	I had to take those things, those people's family should take care about them. We only have ourselves.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I don't want to talk about how I got these supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	Don't ask me how I got these things. Just be glad we have them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I know it's wrong, but I had to take what we need. Otherwise we'd have no chance.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	I'm not proud of it, but I had to steal from those poor people. We are in dire need of supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	That elderly couple... I don't think they'll make it without the supplies I took.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	Poor old people... I'd never have done it if we weren't so desperate.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Those old people have so many things, even food and meds, while we have so little. Don't blame me I took some.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	Those elderly people have a family that supports them. They'll be fine.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	What ^CharacterName^ did was very cruel. I hope those old people will be ok.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Poor old people... I can't stop imagining my parents in their situation...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I don't care where and how ^CharacterName^ got supplies. I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't return empty-handed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I don't think stealing from that old couple was necessary. Surely there are other ways to get what we need.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I hope those elderly people have some family to support them. We shouldn't steal from them anymore.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	We haven't got much but we can't turn a blind eye to suffering.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I shared some food with a hungry man. Despite having so little, we need to remain human.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I gave food to a starving man. It wouldn't help us anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	We have little food, but I just had to share it with that poor man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ shared our food with a starving man. We probably won't make it through anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	I wonder if that hungry man has better chances than we do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ did the right thing.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ helped that poor man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Poor guy, I understand why ^CharacterName^ just couldn't refuse to share some food with him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I know supplies are tight, but ^CharacterName^ did the right thing by sharing food with that man from the squat.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Poor man, I hope we don't end up in a situation like his.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I couldn't share food with that man. We have so little ourselves, and it probably wouldn't have made much difference anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	Food is so hard to come by. We don't have enough to share with anyone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Poor guy. If only I could spare some food, I would have. But I have to think about the others.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	If the siege lasts any longer, everyone will begin starving.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	Death of hunger must be horrible, I hope that man from the squat can manage somehow.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	If we start handing out our food to anyone who asks, we won't make it through.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	We are so miserable we couldn't even help that hungry man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	Poor starving man. More and more people will begin starving soon.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I hope that man from the squat is ok. Maybe we should bring him some food?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	That starving man from the squat was just one of hundreds who are trapped in the city.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We need to stick together and help each other, otherwise we might share the fate of that man from the squat.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	We must make sure we don't end up like that poor man from the squat.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Damn those soldiers! They think they can do whatever they want! Fucking criminals!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I saw a soldier abusing a girl... We had better avoid those pigs.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	What happened to that girl was terrible but that soldier would have hurt me worse, had I interfered.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	What happened to that girl happens every day in wartime. If I'd tried to help her, that soldier would've killed me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I feel sorry for that girl... but what was I supposed to do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	I saw a soldier abusing some poor girl. I'm just glad it wasn't anyone I know.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	That soldier was so cruel to that girl... And I was too powerless to stop him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	That pig took advantage of a defenseless girl but I couldn't stop him... It would've put us all in danger if I had.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I couldn't help that girl. I couldn't do anything. I felt so powerless.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	What that soldier did to that poor girl... how can anyone be so cruel? If only I was strong enough to save her...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	There was nothing ^CharacterName^ could do to save that girl.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	It's so sad that ^CharacterName^ couldn't save that girl.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	What that soldier did to that poor girl... how can anyone be so cruel? If only ^CharacterName^ had helped her...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Poor girl... I can't stop thinking about what happened to her...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I pity that girl... but that soldier would have done much worse to ^CharacterName^, had {mr|he}{fr|she} interfered.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Poor girl... We should avoid those cruel military scumbags.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ couldn't risk helping that girl, he would've put us all in danger.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	Where were that girl's friends? Or family? ^CharacterName^ wasn't obliged to save her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	That soldier was so cruel to that girl... And ^CharacterName^ was too powerless to stop him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	The military are so cruel... we have to make sure we're able to defend ourselves against them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Poor, defenseless girl, abused by that monster... but if ^CharacterName^ had tried to stop him, we could have all been in danger.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	That unfortunate girl... I can't imagine something like that happen to my sister, daughter, or friend.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I can understand why ^CharacterName^ did not help that girl. It was too dangerous.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlHurt/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	What could have ^CharacterName^ done against that soldier? They're trained killers!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Bastards think they can do anything they want! Glad I was there to save that girl.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Saving that girl was so risky, I could've got killed. What was I thinking?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	My hands are still trembling. That soldier could've killed me but I did the right thing.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I helped that girl. She should be grateful I was there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I saved that girl. Would anyone do the same for one of us, I wonder?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	I sure hope helping that girl did not put us in danger. We have enough problems already.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I don't want to imagine what would have happened had I not saved that girl.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I'm glad I saved that girl. How can the military do such things?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I saved that girl... but how many more are less fortunate every night of this war?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm so glad I managed to save that girl. I hope the poor thing is alright.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ managed to save that girl... but how many are less fortunate every night of this war?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ saved that girl... this time.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm so glad ^CharacterName^ managed to save that girl. I hope the poor thing is alright.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I don't want to think what would've happened if ^CharacterName^ hadn't been there to save that girl.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Snipers are the worst scum! The bastard almost got me like he got that man!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	That was too close. I could've ended up like that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	That was too close... It could've been me lying there, bleeding, instead of that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	What happened to that man proves that place's reputation. We should avoid it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I didn't help that man... I was so scared.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	We have to be careful, or we'll end up like that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I keep thinking about that man... It could've been one of us lying there, bleeding.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	That poor man and his baby... Why didn't anyone help them?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Could I have helped that man? Or would he have bled to death anyway?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	That man needed my help but I was scared, I didn't know what to do...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	It's a shame ^CharacterName^ didn't help that man but {mr|he}{fr|she} could've got killed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ left that man to die. Was there anything {mr|he}{fr|she} could've done?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	That poor man... Why didn't ^CharacterName^ help him?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Why did ^CharacterName^ ignore that man's call for help?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	It's sad that ^CharacterName^ did not help that man. But I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} survived.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	^CharacterName^ could've got killed by that sniper, if {mr|he}{fr|she} had tried to help that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	Why do they hunt us like animals? What did we do to them?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	What happened to that man could happen to any of us. We have to be careful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	One day we might all end up like that man, shot by a sniper. And no one will help us, either.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	Will this killing never stop? How can those murderers shoot civilians like that? Poor man...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I was so worried about ^CharacterName^. I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} made it back alive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	^CharacterName^ could've got killed there. What would we do then?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ told me about the sniper. I'm glad it wasn't me out there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I can understand why ^CharacterName^ did not help that man. It was too dangerous.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	I hope that sniper will burn in hell! How can he shoot civilians and stand to look at his own face in the mirror?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	It was close, too close, but I made it, and that man was grateful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	It was worth helping that man, he was really grateful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I helped that man but I'd rather not think about what would have happened if I'd got hit as well.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	That man wouldn't have made it without my help, but I was lucky to survive too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	That man had no one else to help him. If it hadn't been for me, he'd be dead now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I helped that man, but there's no telling if he survives another day.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I'm glad I could help that man. Every one of us could be in his position.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I helped that man, but how many more children will have lost their fathers before this war ends?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm so glad I could help that man and his child.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ helped that man, but how many more children will be orphaned by this war?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	What will come of that man's child? With this war around, can it have any hope for a happy childhood?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm so glad ^CharacterName^ helped that man and his child!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I feel much better knowing that man and his child are safe.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Fucking sniper finished the job and left the guy's corpse on the street. Do they think it will scare me off?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Another body at the Sniper Junction. I wonder if the shooter made a mark on his rifle.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I've seen what the sniper bullet did to that guy we'd met before. It might have been me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	That man's body reminded me how dangerous it is to search for supplies around the Sniper Junction.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	The Sniper Junction is dangerous for scavengers, but that man was simply going back home...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	It's not easy to cross the Sniper Junction, but it's possible. The man we'd met must've been too careless.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	Another man killed by snipers. Maybe we should stay away from the Sniper Junction.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	It's good that we didn't decide to hide in the vicinity of the Sniper Junction, it's even more dangerous than around here. Too bad the man we met didn't have such a choice.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I've seen too many people shot by snipers... And that man is not the first one to leave a child parentless.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	If only I could have done something to help that man at the Sniper Junction... What will become of his family?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ told us about the man killed by the sniper... I don't want to think about it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	I hope ^CharacterName^ doesn't blame {mr|himself}{fr|herself} for the death of that man at the Sniper Junction...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Could we have helped that man at the Sniper Junction...? I hope his son will be alright.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	That man at the Sniper Junction had so much will to live on... Too bad it wasn't enough.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ saw a man killed by the sniper. It would take just one sharpshooter set up near our place to kill us all.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	How many lives has that sniper taken? The poor man joined the victim list.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ said that the man from the Sniper Junction is dead. This is not the only place where you can get shot, we have to be extra careful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManSeenDead/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	^CharacterName^ should stay away from that damned place. There was nothing {mr|he}{fr|she} could do to help that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Our supplies are low, but sharing with the hospital can make a bigger impact.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I traded with the doctor at the hospital. It wasn't the best deal, but the hospital serves the whole community.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I donated some things to the hospital. Seemed to me they were in need.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	When I saw the patients struggling at the hospital, I couldn't help myself but give the doctor some supplies. I hope this will help save more lives.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	The things ^CharacterName^ donated to the hospital can save the patients' lives. I only hope we won't need those items in the future.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	We can't really afford to give away our things, but it's good we've made an exception for the hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We're in this together. It's our hospital and the patients' lives are our concern.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	^CharacterName^ made the call and traded with the doctor. This time it was about something more than just our profit.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ gave some things to the people at the hospital. We are yet to see if it can make any difference.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	The patients now stand a better chance of survival. What about us, though? Will we live on...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I admire ^CharacterName^ for helping those people at the hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Helping others is our weapon against violence and insensitivity. ^CharacterName^ set a good example at the hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I took some useful stuff from the hospital... Can they manage without it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Those patients... I know it's not right to steal from hospitals but I gotta look after my group.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	For some, it doesn't matter anymore if it's a hospital or a brothel. We've become animals, we only care about survival.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	Those people are already sick... What will become of them, now that I've taken the hospital supplies?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	It was wrong to steal from the hospital, but I was desperate. Our situation is really bad.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	There's never enough bandages and medicine, but taking them from the hospital...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	^CharacterName^ must've been really desperate to rob the hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	It was ^CharacterName^ who robbed the hospital, but somehow I still feel responsible.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I know it's hard for us but... did it really have to be the hospital?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ stole something from the hospital. Now we can live a little big longer at their expense.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	There were times I would have condemned ^CharacterName^ for robbing the hospital...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	The hospital still stands thanks to this famous doctor. He's a hero... While we're the opposite.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	How could we rob a hospital? They're already having a hard time!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	And, again, I risked my life for someone else...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	This brothel is an evil place where women get hurt! I had to act, helping them was the right thing to do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Clearly, some of the women in the brothel were mistreated by those gangsters. It was risky to help them but I hope it can inspire people to act.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Yeah, we saved someone in the brothel. But one spared life or two won't make any difference.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	When ^CharacterName^ discovered that some women were working in the brothel against their will, {mr|he}{fr|she} decided to help them. I admire {mr|him}{fr|her} for that.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ acted bravely in that brothel. What if someone we know ended up at the mercy of those thugs?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHotel/Help/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I don't really remember what happened in that hotel. Did I really save someone?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHotel/Help/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	Those maniacs were doing horrible things to people. At least they won't hurt the one I met.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHotel/Help/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Our community doesn't need deranged criminals. I let them know we're vigilant.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHotel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I heard ^CharacterName^ saved a man held by some gang.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHotel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	War brings out the worst in some, the best in others. I really hope we never become the former.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHotel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I'm sure ^CharacterName^ risked helping that hostage for a good reason.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestConstructionSnipers/KillSnipers/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I took two lives to save a few.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestConstructionSnipers/KillSnipers/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	Killing those men was the only way to stop them. Dozens are now safer.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestConstructionSnipers/KillSnipers/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	The snipers are this city's menace. Getting rid of those two wasn't easy, but it'll make the streets safer.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestConstructionSnipers/KillSnipers/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	That rush of adrenaline... I'll gladly kill more of those bastards if I get the chance.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestConstructionSnipers/KillSnipers/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Snipers kill indiscriminately. It actually felt good to repay those bastards in kind!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestConstructionSnipers/KillSnipers/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	They're killing us, we're killing them… One vicious circle.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestConstructionSnipers/KillSnipers/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Killing is wrong, but two armed soldiers in exchange for dozens of innocent civilians... I hope it justifies ^CharacterName^'s deed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestConstructionSnipers/KillSnipers/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	The people of the city should thank ^CharacterName^ for taking care of those snipers.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	So hungry... I'd kill for a can of meat...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	Has anyone got any food left? I have to eat something!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I'm really worried about our lack of food. I can hear my stomach rumbling.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	We need to find more food, or we'll start starving.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I wish I could help ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} looks so hungry...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We need to make sure we have enough food for everybody!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Unless I eat something soon, I'm a goner...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	How long has it been since I last ate? I'm starving...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I'm getting weaker each day... I'm starving...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	My heart breaks when I look at ^CharacterName^... We must get {mr|him}{fr|her} some food.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Have we got any food left for ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} looks very hungry...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Look at ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} is so miserable... How long has it been since {mr|he}{fr|she} last ate?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We must get ^CharacterName^ some food, we can't let {mr|him}{fr|her} starve!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I'm so weak... If I don't get something to eat, I'm done for... I can't die here...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Agressive/00	So hungry... Where the fuck is our food? I'm sure I saw a can somewhere! Who took it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Please, get me some food... Anything will do, please... I'm dying here..
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I guess this is it... with no food I'm as good as dead. I'd steal something if I could...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Food... I need to eat something... anything... please...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I'm starving... I guess there are worse ways to die...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I may die of hunger but at least others will live… maybe.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I won't forgive myself if ^CharacterName^ dies of hunger...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	It's so painful to watch someone slowly starve to death...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	With no food, ^CharacterName^'s as good as dead... Are we all destined to end up like that?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	It pains me to watch ^CharacterName^ starve when the military have plenty of food. It's so unfair!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I'm afraid ^CharacterName^ will starve to death, soon. We are so miserable.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	I guess this is it... If we can't get enough food, soon we'll start dying one by one...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We must find some food, or poor ^CharacterName^ is going to die.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We need to get some food and we need to act quickly! We can't let any of us die of hunger!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ will probably die of those wounds. We should give {mr|him}{fr|her} a proper burial when {mr|he}{fr|she} does.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	Is there anything we can do to save ^CharacterName^ from bleeding to death? I've lost all hope...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	If we don't dress that wound properly, ^CharacterName^ will die. We must get the bandages at all cost!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	We cannot let ^CharacterName^ die of these wounds! We have to do something!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ won't make it through unless we dress that wound. We need bandages!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Unless we get some bandages, ^CharacterName^ will die! We can't let that happen, we need {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	We need to get some bandages for ^CharacterName^ even if it means taking them from other people!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	I'd rob a hospital if I knew this could save ^CharacterName^'s life.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^'s wounds are very serious... {mr|He}{fr|She} will probably die.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ is dying... and without bandages there is nothing we can do about it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ is badly wounded and won't make it through without bandages...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	^CharacterName^'s wound looks really bad, I hope it's not too late to get some bandages.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	What the fuck happened to all our bandages?! I can't believe there are none left for me, I'm dying here!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I don't want to die... Please, anyone... tend to my wounds... please...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	It hurts so much... Can't anyone share bandages with me?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Damn this wound... Please, help me... I'll die without bandages...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	Help me, please! My wound hurts so much...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	If my wounds aren't tended to, I'll die... I've gone this far... don't let me die now...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	I need bandages... Please... Even if we have to take them from someone else...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	This might be my end... Unless someone gets bandages, I'm not gonna make it... Please, help me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	I don't wanna die like this... not like this...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I'm badly wounded, I don't think I can make it through unless my friends get some bandages.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	I gotta be strong, my friends have it rough as well. But it hurts so much...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ committed murder. If this is what we have become, maybe we do deserve to die...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	Have we started killing each other for scraps of food? How can we live like that?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ murdered someone last night... I feel guilty, maybe I could have done something to prevent it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Killing is not the way... How can we live with it when the war is over?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ killed someone... What has it come to... Will we commit just about any crime to survive?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Is it really kill or be killed? I still hope it's not...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ murdered someone in cold blood. I know {mr|he}{fr|she} did it for us. We're all guilty.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	How many people do we have to kill to survive? Is it even worth it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ murdered someone last night... What have we become?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Are we gonna kill anyone who stands in our way? Are we willing to live with that?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	I'm fed up with this war, but If someone stands in my way, I'll kill them without hesitation.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	If ^CharacterName^ killed, there was probably no other way.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I'd rather ^CharacterName^ killed than if {mr|he}{fr|she} got killed. We need {mr|him}{fr|her}
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I will not die here, I plan to survive this hell and I won't let anyone stand in my way.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	It's the law of the jungle in war... You kill or you die, there's no other way... If I hadn't done that, someone else would have...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	There was no other way. We need supplies to survive, how else are we supposed to get them?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	This is war... we do everything to survive... I... I had no choice...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Death is the only way out of this hell... The dead have no more worries, they are the lucky ones.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I did not want to kill anyone... I'm not evil... I... I... had no choice...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I killed. It weighs heavily on my conscience, but that's the only way we can survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	Some stranger died rather than me or any of my friends, and I prefer it that way. It's as simple as that.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/NPCKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I did what I did, for all of us. I know it's horrible and I'll have to live with it, but this is war.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ took someone else's supplies. We might last a few more days if we're lucky.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	We're like wretched rats, stealing from other poor souls to survive...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Is stealing really the only way to get what we need? What about those people we robbed, how are they to survive now?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	How can we steal from others? They have a hard time trying to survive as well!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	What matters is that we have supplies. How we got them is of less concern.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	We can cry over stealing once we survive this hell.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ did it for us. We should be thankful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	If we make it through, we will have ^CharacterName^ to thank.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Perhaps we shouldn't have stolen, but how else can we survive?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Supplies are so hard to come by. If ^CharacterName^ hadn't stolen goods, we'd be in an even worse situation now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	We really are wretched... fighting over bits and scraps, like rats.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	Those poor people... I hope they will be ok... I feel terrible but we need supplies to survive...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Poor people... I know it was cruel to take their supplies but it's either them or us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I had to steal. We need supplies and it's so hard to get them otherwise.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	I'll steal if I fucking have to! I want to make it through, alive and kicking.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WeCommitRobery/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I don't plan to die here. If it means I sometimes have to steal, so be it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Damn bandits! We should get some guns and kill the motherfuckers!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/01	Damn bastards! I can't believe they dared come here! We should kill them all!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Damn thieves. As if we already didn't have it hard enough.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	How am I to survive if thugs are trying to kill me and take my things?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	Damn those looters! We need to protect our supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	Damn thugs! If they come again, they're dead!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	We won't survive if we can't defend our shelter. We have to make sure we can.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Defending our shelter against looters is crucial. We need to make sure we have enough weapons and keep watch at night.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	As if the war and shortage of supplies wasn't enough, someone came at night to rob us!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We need to make sure we can defend our shelter, otherwise we are done for.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ didn't make it back last night. I'd cry, but I have no more tears left.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ was killed. Which one of us will be next?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ was killed last night while scavenging. If I had gone instead, maybe {mr|he}{fr|she} would still be with us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I can't stop thinking about ^CharacterName^'s death. Could we have done anything to prevent it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	Bloody murderers! They killed ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/01	^CharacterName^ is dead. I'd like to get my hands on {mr|his}{fr|her} killer!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ was killed last night. I'm glad it wasn't me, I have to be careful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I don't want to get killed like ^CharacterName^... Maybe I could stay in the shelter while someone else goes out to search for supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	Someone killed ^CharacterName^ last night! We should avenge {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	I will never forgive ^CharacterName^'s killer! Never!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	Another senseless death. No one cares if we live or die. The world has forsaken us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	If we can't protect our own, how are we to make it through this hell?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ did not return from the scavenge last night. We will miss {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Oh, ^CharacterName^... We have to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	We will have a much harder time without ^CharacterName^ to scavenge for us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	It's most unfortunate that ^CharacterName^ got {mr|himself}{fr|herself} killed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ didn't make it back alive. I will miss {mr|his}{fr|her} company.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	It's really sad that ^CharacterName^ is no longer among us. We will relate {mr|his}{fr|her} story to {mr|his}{fr|her} close ones after the war.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	We didn't even have enough supplies to save ^CharacterName^'s life. We are so wretched!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	We lacked power to save ^CharacterName^'s life...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/02	Sadly, ^CharacterName^ was beyond saving.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I wish we could've done something to save ^CharacterName^... If only we'd had more supplies...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Why did you have to die, ^CharacterName^? Was there really nothing we could do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/02	I'm afraid ^CharacterName^'s death is our fault. We could've been more tenacious in search for supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ died. I have to make sure we have enough food, bandages and meds in case I need them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I don't want to end up like ^CharacterName^. There has to be a way to secure more supplies!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/02	If someone had to die, better ^CharacterName^ than me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	We must get more supplies if we don't want to end up like ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	We have to secure more food, meds and bandages, or we'll all die like ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/02	^CharacterName^ could've been saved, but we are seriously undersupplied. We need to do something about it, no matter what.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Poor ^CharacterName^. If only we'd had enough supplies...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Couldn't we have done anything? Did ^CharacterName^ really have to die?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/02	We must be more persistent in gathering supplies, so that none of us shares ^CharacterName^'s fate.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^'s death shows we are weak. We must make sure no one else dies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	We can't let any more of our friends die. Even if it means taking someone else's supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/02	^CharacterName^ died because we were not strong enough to secure the necessary supplies. We must be more tenacious.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	We've lost ^CharacterName^. Without supplies, we're soon to follow.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	Without the most vital supplies, we will all die like ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/02	We didn't have enough supplies to save ^CharacterName^. If we don't find some, we're as good as dead, too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^'s death could've been prevented, we just needed more supplies! Let's make sure this won't happen again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I can't believe it. How could we let ^CharacterName^ die?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/02	We've lost ^CharacterName^. We will not forget {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ was killed last night by looters. War has turned people into beasts.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	Shelling, snipers... And now this. People killing each other for scraps of food.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Bandits killed ^CharacterName^. We should've protected {mr|him}{fr|her} better...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	^CharacterName^ was murdered in cold blood. I hope those criminals face trial when the war is over.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Fucking bandits! We will avenge ^CharacterName^ if they come back!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/01	Bloody bastards! I hope you die and burn in hell for what you did to ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Looters killed ^CharacterName^. I was lucky it wasn't me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	That was close... It could've been me lying there dead instead of ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Too bad... but better ^CharacterName^ than me, I guess.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	^CharacterName^ is dead. If the bandits come back, I might be next. We must get more guns!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	With ^CharacterName^ killed by looters it will be much tougher to survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	We have to defend ourselves! It's kill or be killed!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Bandits killed ^CharacterName^ last night! We must protect ourselves better!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	If we don't find a way to keep bandits at bay, we will soon follow ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	Bandits killed ^CharacterName^. If we can't defend ourselves, we won't survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	We can't let them prey on us like that. We must avenge ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	Bandits attacked us last night and killed ^CharacterName^. Next time it might be me, but I don't care anymore.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	I don't care anymore. Let them kill us all, better to die quickly than suffer a long, slow death from hunger and disease.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Bandits attacked us last night and killed ^CharacterName^! We must keep watch and stick together!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	If we can't protect each other from bandits, we're as good as dead. Let's be better prepared for the future.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	They say freezing to death is like falling asleep. Maybe that's the best we can hope for.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ froze to death... {mr|he}{fr|she} fell asleep and simply didn't wake up.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Poor ^CharacterName^ died of cold last night... If only we had gathered more firewood, {mr|he}{fr|she} would still be among us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	How could we let ^CharacterName^ freeze to death? We just needed more things to burn...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ froze to death. If we don't find more firewood I could be next...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I don't want to die of hypothermia like ^CharacterName^, I must do something to prevent it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	The freezing cold took ^CharacterName^. We need to keep our shelter warmer.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	That's it. We need more firewood, even if it means taking it from other people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	We must gather more firewood, otherwise we might all freeze like poor ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	No amount of food and meds will save us if we can't keep our shelter warm.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	We need to keep the shelter warm, otherwise we'll all die like ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	We must gather something to burn in the heaters, even if it means taking it from someone else.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ did not make it through the night. The winter cold will kill us where bullets and shells cannot.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	Is that it, then? Are we all going to die of cold like ^CharacterName^?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	How could we let ^CharacterName^ die of cold? We need to keep the fire up at all times if we want to survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	If we want to make it, we must get something to burn in the heaters!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	If I got my hands on whoever killed ^CharacterName^...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/01	If I meet ^CharacterName^'s killers, they are dead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I had a feeling it was a bad idea to go, but ^CharacterName^ wouldn't have listened anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Leaving the shelter is so dangerous, we should avoid it unless absolutely necessary.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	If I had gone instead of ^CharacterName^, it could be me lying dead somewhere.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	We shouldn't be thinking about helping others when we've got so many problems on our heads. ^CharacterName^ didn't agree, and is now dead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ could not refuse to help our neighbor, and now {mr|he}{fr|she} is dead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	If ^CharacterName^ hadn't tried to help our neighbor, {ms|he}{fs|she}'d still be alive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Perhaps ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have gone there, but now it's too late...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I'll miss ^CharacterName^. {mr|He}{fr|She} wasn't perfect, but none of us is.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^'s death goes only to show that we have to mind our own business.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	If ^CharacterName^ had refused to go, {mr|he}{fr|she}'d still be with us. That was careless and unnecessary.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	We've lost ^CharacterName^, and for what?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	^CharacterName^ took an unnecessary risk, {mr|he}{fr|she} could still be with us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	One by one, they'll get us all...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	We're like hunted animals. Poor ^CharacterName^ did not have to die like that...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	Cold as it may sound, I think we should only care about our own, or we'll all end up like ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	Losing ^CharacterName^ is a blow. {ms|He}{fs|She} shouldn't have gone to help people we barely know.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ showed solidarity towards our neighbors and paid the highest price for it. I'll miss {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	What ^CharacterName^ did was noble. We should help our neighbors whenever we can.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ returned. What if {mr|he}{fr|she} doesn't come back one day?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ returned to us safely.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I was worried about ^CharacterName^, I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} is back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	It's good to have ^CharacterName^ with us again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	The worst thing is waiting, when you don't know if your friend will be back or not.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back, I need {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I knew ^CharacterName^ would make it back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	It's good that ^CharacterName^ returned. We need all hands on deck in order to survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	I feel safer when we're all here together. I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Agressive/00	Without meds I'm as good as dead. Has anyone got any left?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Agressive/01	This sickness is killing me, maybe we could steal some meds?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I must get some meds. I don't care how. I don't want to die like this.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Unless I get some meds, I'll die. Surely, there is some way to get them? Someone must have them...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I can't die of sickness, I want to live! Do something!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	Don't let me die, make sure I get some meds...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm very sick, but give the meds to the others first. I'll try to hold on a little longer.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	This fever is terrible, but I wouldn't forgive myself if someone died because I took the meds that could have saved them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I need meds, badly. Let's steal them if we have to.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	Get me some meds, you need me!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	If I don't get meds, I'm not going to pull through.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	Don't let me die, please... please...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	We're very sick, we desperately need meds.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	This illness will kill us unless we get some meds.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	My friends are sick... Is there any hope for them?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	Disease is killing my friends, and I can't help them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	My friends are sick, I gotta help them get the meds!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Without my help my friends might die from disease, I must get them some medicine quickly.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	We must get some meds somehow, anyhow!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Without meds, the disease will kill us all.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	I must get meds for my friends. Whatever it takes.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	Without meds my friends will die. I can't let that happen!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	My friends are dying from disease and I am powerless to prevent it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	They're so sick... and I can't help them...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	My friends are very sick, I have to do something!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I must do all I can to save my friends from the disease!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	We are starving, maybe someone could share some food with us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	I'm so hungry, but we all need to share.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	The situation is getting dire, we need food.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	We can't just sit idly, we need to get food as soon as possible!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I have to eat something, I feel so weak...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	Have we got any food left? I'm starving...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	We won't survive if we can't get food.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	We gotta get food somehow, we must think of something.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	My friends are starving... I need to get food and share it with them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	It pains me to see my friends starve.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	My friends are starving while I'm not. It's not right.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	My friends need food. I should share with them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	This might be it... we're dying of hunger...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	We're starving. Will anyone help? Maybe we could trade something for food...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Without food, is there still hope for us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	At least we will die together, my friends.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	We failed to get enough food... this probably is the end.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	Unless a miracle happens, we're as good as dead...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I don't care that others are hungry, too. I need food, or I'll die! And I don't intend to die here!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	I'm starving! If I find out that someone ate my rations...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I need food or I'll die, can't you see?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	You have to get me some food! You just have to!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Atruistic/00	They're dying of hunger...I should give them my share.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Atruistic/01	I should share the little I have with my friends. They're starving...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	How can I eat when my friends are starving?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I shouldn't take another bite without sharing with my friends.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Are there any animals left in the city? I'm so hungry I'd even eat a rat, or a pigeon.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	I must get some food at all cost. Gotta think of some way to do it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Getting food is now a priority. We must persevere.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	Without food we'll die, we must search harder for it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I wish I could help my friends, they look so hungry...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	My friends are very hungry, getting food for them should be my priority.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Agressive/00	I'm fucking dying here, get me some bandages! Anyone!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Please, tend to my wounds... please...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Don't let me bleed to death. Dress my wounds, please.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	Without bandages I'll die... help me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	I'm bleeding, you gotta get me some bandages.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Altruist/00	Maybe someone could help us get the bandages we need...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Altruist/01	We're wounded, we need help...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Is this it? After all I've been through, am I to die like this?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	Just look at my wound... please, you have to do something about it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	We're wounded, we need bandages badly...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	We need help, without bandages we'll bleed to death...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	My friends are bleeding and I can't do anything about it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	I feel so helpless, my friends are wounded and I can't even ease their pain.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm worried about my friends... I have to get bandages for them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	It's so painful to watch my friends suffer from wounds.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I have to get my hands on some bandages! We won't survive without them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Without bandages we're doomed. We need to get them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	That's it. My friends are getting bandages even if I have to steal them from someone!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	I gotta get some bandages for my friends. We can trade something for them, can't we?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	We haven't got enough bandages... I failed my friends...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	It's hopeless... my friends are dying of wounds and I can't help them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I gotta get some bandages for my friends!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I need to find some bandages tonight. I can't fail my friends!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	What difference does it make if we hurt someone or not or if we're going to leave them with no supplies? They won't survive anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I can't believe I hurt someone and took their things... Was that really necessary for our survival?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I know it was us or them, still I feel bad about it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I did what was necessary. What matters is that I obtained some supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I wouldn't have done it if our survival didn't depend on it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	So now we're hurting people and stealing from them...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	It's one thing to steal and another to hurt someone while you're at it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I still don't believe ^CharacterName^ hurt someone and stole their things.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Have we become brutal thugs?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	If we have to use force to obtain supplies, so be it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	Reality is cruel. If we are to survive we have to be equally cruel.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I'd rather we didn't hurt anyone, but if our survival so requires...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Can't we manage without hurting others?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	The strong always prey on the weak, we're no different.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Hurting others and robbing them... we've become bandits.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BeatAndItemsStolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We're no better than the military, using force to get what they want.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I killed those people. They probably wouldn't have survived anyway. I just eased their pain.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	They're dead. I'm alive. Better than the other way around.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/02	That was risky, I'm glad I made it back alive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I had to kill them, you must understand that I had no choice.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	What I did was horrible but this is war. People kill each other all the time, don't they?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/02	You mustn't tell anyone I did it. Don't even think about it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	Think about your families and loved ones. We have to survive for them, no matter the cost.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I did what was necessary to ensure our survival. You would've done the same.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/02	If we have to kill to survive, so be it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Maybe those people deserved to die? Maybe they committed some horrible crime?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	In the animal world it's kill or be killed. War turns us into animals.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/02	I regret what I did, but you must understand me, everyone wants to survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I'll never manage to wash their blood off my hands... this'll haunt me forever.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	I didn't want to kill anyone, I didn't want it to happen, but it did! Leave me alone! I can't live like this... I...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/02	I really don't want to talk about what happened there, please don't ask...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I still can't believe those people are dead. And that it was I who did it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	I don't know how I should go on, knowing that I killed those people. Maybe it would have been better if I had died there instead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/02	Poor people... I really didn't want it to end like that...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I didn't intend to kill anyone. It's this ugly war. It turned brothers against brothers.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	I'm not proud of what I did. If only there had been any other way,...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/02	Sooner or later, everyone in this damned city will be dead. It's just a matter of time.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	Those people stood in the way of our survival. I had no choice, did I?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	I did what was necessary. Don't ask me about it ever again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/02	Don't presume to judge me. You weren't there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I did not want to kill anyone, you have to believe me. You have to.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	I did it for all of us. I'll do whatever is necessary to get us through this hell.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/02	If only those deaths could've been avoided...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	War turns decent people into murderers... maybe we'd be better off if we had died in the first days of this conflict.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	We all have to live now with the thought that ^CharacterName^ killed those people for us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/02	What will happen to ^CharacterName^ when the war is over? Will {mr|he}{fr|she} go to prison?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ must now be going through hell after all the things {mr|he}{fr|she} did.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I still can't believe ^CharacterName^ killed those people. How could {mr|he}{fr|she}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/02	To be forced to take other people's lives... That must've been horribly painful for ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	What ^CharacterName^ did was terrible, but who are we to judge {mr|him}{fr|her}? We weren't there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	If my life was at stake, I'd defend myself. ^CharacterName^ did just that. Let's not talk about it anymore.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/02	Those deaths will weigh heavily on ^CharacterName^'s conscience, but thanks to {mr|him}{fr|her} we will survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	Now we all have to live with the thought that ^CharacterName^ killed those people for us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	We're no better than criminals. Maybe we don't deserve to survive this war.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/02	If anyone saw ^CharacterName^ kill those people, after the war {mr|he}{fr|she} will get a life sentence.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ must have had no choice. Otherwise {mr|he}{fr|she} wouldn't have killed those people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	^CharacterName^ did what {mr|he}{fr|she} thought was necessary to secure our survival, no matter how horrible it was.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/02	I hope we won't have to kill anyone anymore...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruist/Apathic/00	Blood... So much blood...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruist/Apathic/01	I killed many people, they're all dead now...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruist/00	I... I... Don't know how it happened... Don't ask me about it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruist/01	It didn't happen, it was just a nightmare, I'll wake up and everything will be alright...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	Those fuckers deserved to die! I killed them and I'll kill again if I have to!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	What are those deaths in comparison with all other casualties of this war? Just a drop in the ocean.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Killing will never stop. We might as well get used to it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I'm not proud of what I've done, but I really had no choice.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	I'd rather kill than get killed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	We're back to the stone age. Fighting other tribes for survival. Can anyone blame us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	For now, only survival matters. There will be time for regrets when the war is over.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I'd never kill anyone unless I had no choice, you must believe me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	Those people are dead now, but there was no other way.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	Are we a menace to society?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	I've got so much blood on my hands, I'm a war criminal.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	I killed many people so that we can live. Can you forgive me?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	My only concern is that we make it through this war alive. The end justifies the means.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I didn't want to kill anyone. But those people were a threat to us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	Trust me, it wasn't easy for me to kill all those people. I wouldn't have done it if it weren't necessary.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ massacred those poor people...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	All those people, murdered by ^CharacterName^, and for what?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I can't believe ^CharacterName^ has become a mass murderer...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	How could ^CharacterName^ kill all those people? How?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	I don't give a fuck if ^CharacterName^ killed someone or not as long as we're alive!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Come on, we have bigger problems than worrying about some people ^CharacterName^ killed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Whining is useless. Those people are dead and nothing can change that now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I don't care what any of you do as long as you bring back food and other supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	What you do out in the city is none of my business as long as you bring back some supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/02	I don't want to know what happened while you were scavenging. That's none of my business.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	Maybe those people ^CharacterName^ killed deserved their fate. Maybe {mr|he}{fr|she} did the city a favor?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	I just want us to survive, I won't ask what ^CharacterName^ had to do to ensure it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Killing is horrible, but what choice did ^CharacterName^ have?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Everyone wants to survive no matter what. Anything can happen if you let your instincts take over.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	It's either us or the other groups. I don't blame ^CharacterName^ for what {mr|he}{fr|she} did.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	^CharacterName^ made a tough decision and has to bear the consequences. But we're not the ones to judge {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	If this siege lasts any longer, we'll all kill each other without the help of the government military.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	Pogoren will soon become a ghost city. We'll all end up in a mass grave.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Poor ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} must feel horrible now...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We should show our support to ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} killed those people for us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/02	^CharacterName^ is surely going through a hard time now, let's show {mr|him}{fr|her} our support.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Coffe/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'd love a cup of coffee...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Coffe/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Another day without coffee.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Coffe/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	A cup of coffee would be lovely. Have we got any left?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Coffe/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	I really miss coffee, how can we work without it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Coffe/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I need coffee! I haven't had anything with caffeine for a few days now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Cigarettes/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I need a smoke to calm my nerves.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Cigarettes/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Are there any cigarettes left?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Cigarettes/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I really need a cigarette.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Cigarettes/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I need to smoke. I haven't smoked anything for a few days now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Stimulants/Cigarettes/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	I have to get some cigarettes.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I wonder if that girl, Anna, is alright. I hope she is.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	I hope that boy finds his Anna. If she comes here, we'll tell her he was looking for her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	There's never enough meds. We can use these. That girl probably won't come.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	Meds are invaluable. We can use them or trade them for something. That girl is most likely dead anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Maybe we should keep these meds for ourselves? What are the odds that the girl is even alive?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	That girl probably won't come, maybe we could put these meds to good use.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Naive boy. His Anna is probably dead. He should've kept the meds for himself.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Even if that girl comes, we don't have to tell her the boy left her some meds. How would she find out the truth?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	That boy cares about this Anna so much that he trusted us. Will she really come here? I wonder.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	That Anna is one lucky girl to have such a friend. Most people would just keep the meds for themselves.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	Maybe we should've taken those meds for keeping? This Anna girl might really need them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	Perhaps we should've taken those meds for Anna. What if she comes here?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	We should've taken those meds, we could really use them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	It would be nice to have some extra meds at hand. We should've taken them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	It was kind of that boy to try and help his girlfriend. Maybe he can still find her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	Poor boy, he still has hope but his girlfriend is probably dead by now. We could've taken the meds, though.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I'm really glad we decided to help that wounded man!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	We did the right thing, that wounded man needed our help!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	When life gets tough, people should stick together. I'm glad we could help our wounded neighbor.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Helping our neighbor was the right thing to do. I'm glad we did it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I'm glad we helped our wounded neighbor. If we hadn't, he'd be dead by now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We helped that wounded man. So if we're in trouble one day, maybe someone will help us as well.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	Why didn't we help our wounded neighbor? Why?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	I can't believe we didn't help our neighbor in need. What has become of us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Our wounded neighbor had only us to count on and we failed him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We should've helped our wounded neighbor. Why didn't we?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	We left our neighbor to die in the street. Was it really too dangerous to help him?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	It was wrong not to help our wounded neighbor. Just wrong.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	If only I had someone to guard the shelter I could have helped my neighbor's wounded brother.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We should help each other, especially in times like these. I'm really glad we decided to help our neighbors.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Our neighbors were kind to us, I'm very glad we decided to help them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	They could've reinforced their shelter without our help. It isn't really our problem.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	Helping those people is an unnecessary risk. We need every pair of hands.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I'm glad we could repay our neighbors for their kindness.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	Thank to us, our neighbors will be safer. I'm glad we decided to help them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	It was very ungrateful of us not to repay our neighbors for their kindness.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We should've helped our neighbors. They were kind to us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Our neighbors' shelter is their problem. We've got plenty of our own problems.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	Sure, they were nice to us, but maybe because they had been planning to use our help all along?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	We could've helped our neighbors in need, but we did not, even though they had been nice to us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We're not very good neighbors are we? We should've helped them reinforce their shelter.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I couldn't help my neighbors reinforce their cellar, I had no one to guard my own shelter.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	We knew how dangerous it was to go to that funeral, we shouldn't have taken that risk.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Going to a funeral under sniper fire? How can anyone be so careless?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	It is dangerous, but we just have to help that poor girl bury her husband.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	Her husband deserves a decent funeral. We will help her bury him despite the risk.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	She must've loved him very much, she risked her life trying to give him a proper funeral. We should've helped her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	It pains me to see that kind girl suffer so much. I don't want to think how many more families are torn apart by war like that.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	It would be ironic and kind of romantic if she got shot while trying to bury her husband.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I wish someone would love me so much as to risk their life to give me a proper funeral.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Helping that girl bury her husband wouldn't change anything. He's dead either way and she has to live with it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Risk our lives to bury a dead person? That would be just plain stupid.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Should we have risked our lives to help bury that girl's husband under sniper fire?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	Whoever said that love conquers all was wrong. He's dead. She lives. She's young, she'll carry on, forget about him and marry again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I was really sorry, but I couldn't help my neighbor bury her husband. I had to stay in the shelter.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I'm happy we could help those children. I really hope their mother will recover.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	Poor kids, I'd rather not think what would happen if we hadn't given them those meds.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We just couldn't leave those poor kids without help. That would be callous.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Those kids are very brave. They risk their lives walking around the neighborhood to save their mother.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Meds are hard to come by, but we did the right thing.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	Poor children, I hope our meds are enough to help their mother.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	How could we be so callous and not help those poor kids?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	Did we really leave those kids without any help?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We should've helped those kids, they're our neighbors. If we don't help them, who will?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Let's hope some other neighbor helps those kids get meds for their mother.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I wish we had enough meds to share them with anyone in need. We just have to grit our teeth and wait for a ceasefire.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	There's no telling if these kids were telling the truth. Maybe they'd just sell our meds to someone?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Those children asking for meds were out of luck. Our cabinet was empty.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We'd have given those children meds if we'd only had any left.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_03	Unfortunately we had no meds to give to those poor children.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	We haven't got much to share, but a smile on a child's face is priceless.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	We must help one another despite the hardships. I'm glad we shared food with those kids.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	We gave those children some food, but I don't think they'll make it through anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	I'm afraid that despite our help these kids might not make it through.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I'm glad we helped those kids and their mother. I hope they'll make it through.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	We haven't got much in terms of supplies, but we did the right thing.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	When this war is over we'll throw a barbecue party, invite all our neighbors, and eat until we're stuffed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Kids are our future, we have to do everything to save them and show them that despite the war there are good people among us, too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	A hungry child is a heartbreaking sight. I'm glad we gave them some food.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	No child should ever be hungry. We just had to share food with them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	It's a shame we didn't share food with those hungry children.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	The sight of hungry children is heartbreaking.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	Someone will surely help those kids, we haven't got enough food to share.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	What if these kids were lying? We gave them meds, maybe they thought us naive enough to give them anything they asked for?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Poor kids, It's sad we didn't give them any food, but we need it just as badly as they do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	How do we know these kids were telling the truth? Maybe someone sent them to take advantage of our compassion?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We should've given those children some food. Their eyes were so sad...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Let's hope some other neighbor shares food with those kids.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I wish we had enough food to share them with anyone in need. We just have to grit our teeth and wait for a ceasefire.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	There's no telling if these kids were telling the truth. Maybe they'd just sell our food to someone?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	We'd share some food with those hungry children, if only we had any left.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	It was sad that we couldn't help those hungry children.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_03	I wish we could have helped those children.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	That woman might die of illness. Even if we haven't done more for her, at least we can help take her to hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	I'm relieved that we decided to take that woman to hospital, but it could've been avoided if we had given her the meds she needed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We won't let those children become orphaned, we will save their mother. I just wish we could do more for them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Maybe if we had given those children the meds they'd asked for, there would be no need to take their mother to hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	We're saving those children's mother. She should be grateful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I feel good about helping those children's mother. I hope it's in her nature to give back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Those children were wise to come to us for help. They nearly lost their mother.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We just couldn't refuse to help those children's mother. I hope someone would do the same for us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	Did we really ignore those children's pleas? I'm at a loss for words.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	I can't believe we didn't take those children's mother to hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We should've at least tried to save those children's mother.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Even if going out in broad daylight is risky, we should not have left those children without help.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	The military are responsible for shortages in supplies. Those children's mother would be alright if not for them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Were we to risk coming under sniper fire in broad daylight trying to help some stranger? I'm not convinced.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Would sending someone to try to get that woman to hospital be worth it? It would probably have resulted in both of them getting shot.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	We didn't risk helping those children's mother. We could have been shot by a sniper, but it still makes me sad.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	Maybe we could've done something to help those children's mother, but can anyone blame us for not risking our lives for a stranger?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I couldn't help those children take their mother to hospital. My shelter could've got ransacked in my absence.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I'm glad we decided to help our neighbors. We should save as many lives as possible.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	Those people buried under falling debris needed our help, and we didn't fail them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	If a shell hit our shelter, we could be in a similar situation to those people. They could count on us, I hope we can count on them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We just had to go help our neighbors. They would probably do the same for us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I'm glad we helped the people from that collapsed house. It was the right thing to do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	The people from that collapsed house have good neighbors who didn't leave them to their fate. Many others are less fortunate.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	Those poor people... Buried alive or crushed under tons of rubble. Horrible.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	How can the military fire artillery shells at civilians? How can they sleep at night after doing such things?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We should've helped our neighbors from that collapsed building.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We should support each other. We all live in the same street, and yet we left those people to their fate.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Poor people. If I were to choose, I think I'd rather be crushed immediately than suffocate slowly under tonnes of debris.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	I don't want to imagine what I'd do if I were buried under tons of rubble from a collapsed building.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I couldn't leave the shelter unguarded, even though those people really needed my help.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I'm glad that girl's father is alright. She shouldn't have brought us some gift, though.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	I'm sure those earrings were dear to her, but it would have been rude to refuse her gift. What matters is that her father is alright.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	It's good to know some people remember what gratitude is. We can trade those earrings for something we need.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	It was nice of that girl to thank us. Her gift will come in handy when we need to barter for something.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Those earrings will go for a good price. I'm glad we didn't refuse to take them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	It would be stupid to refuse such a nice gift. We can trade those earrings for something we need, such as food.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	It was nice of that girl to come and thank us like that.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	I'm glad we could help. I'd be grateful too if someone saved my loved one.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I'm glad we helped that girl's father and that we refused to take those earrings. They were precious to her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	Relief in that girl's eyes was reward enough. It was a good decision to refuse a gift of her mother's earrings.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	Those earrings were worth a lot, we could have traded them for something we need!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	Why didn't we take those earrings? Have we got too much stuff to trade?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Maybe we should've accepted that girl's earrings. We could trade them for something useful later.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	That girl wanted to express her gratitude, we shouldn't have refused to take those earrings.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Her gratitude was fine and all, but I sure could use that girl's earrings. They'd buy me a can of meat, or even two.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	It was stupid to refuse such a generous gift! Those earrings would have fetched a good price.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I think it wasn't a good decision to refuse that girl's gift.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	She wanted us to have those earrings, we should've taken them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	It was nice of that girl to offer us her mother's earrings, but we didn't help her father just to get a reward.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	It was nice of her to come over to thank us, but she didn't have to bring a gift for us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I know we need supplies, but I feel bad about helping our neighbor rob that family.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	Regardless of our motivations, helping our neighbor rob that family is wrong.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	We need supplies, and that family has them. I know it's wrong to steal, but we need to survive somehow.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	No one would think of robbing that family if they had shared their stashed supplies. They're just asking for it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	I feel kinda bad. We're helping our neighbor, but it means robbing some other people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	Stealing from those folks is a way to help our neighbor and ourselves, even if it is morally wrong.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	I'm glad we decided to help rob that family. They deserve it, sitting on all those supplies and not sharing with anyone!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	If we could survive without stealing, we wouldn't steal, would we?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	I guess this goes to show that you've got to be able to defend yourself if you're sitting on stashed supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I'm glad we refused to rob that family. That would be wrong.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	Even if that family really is sitting on supplies, I don't think stealing is the way to go.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I think we could've taken a few things from that family. Not much, just enough to help us survive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	Maybe we should've helped our neighbor take supplies from that selfish family?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	That selfish family our neighbor told us about was asking for it. Maybe we should've gone with him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	If we had taken some supplies from that family our neighbor was talking about, we would be much better off now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	I still think our neighbor was right. We should've taken some supplies from those selfish bastards!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Even though we're pressed for supplies, I think we did the right thing refusing to help rob that family.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	That family is selfish and they are ignoring the tragic situation of their neighbors, but stealing from them would not be the way to go.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I feel really bad about deciding to steal from the hospital warehouse. Other people might need meds and bandages as much as we do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	Stealing from that hospital warehouse is wrong. We shouldn't have even considered it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	What matters is that we will have some medical supplies. Does it really make any difference how we get them as long as we can survive?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	We wouldn't have decided to steal those meds and bandages if we weren't so hard pressed for them. It's not our fault there are shortages.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Did we have a choice? Acquiring medical supplies is becoming increasingly difficult.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We really need those medical supplies. What were we supposed to do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I know I should feel bad about stealing those medical supplies, but I don't. We really need them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	A bandage or two doesn't make a world of difference to the hospital, and they're a lifesaver for us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	There's no doubt we need medical supplies, but this doesn't make me feel any less guilty about stealing them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	Desperate times require desperate measures. These medical supplies might mean the difference between life and death for us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I can't believe we reported on our neighbor to those rebel soldiers. How could we?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	How could we snitch to those soldiers about our neighbor? That was really shameful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	Maybe reporting on our neighbor wasn't the right thing to do, but neither was stealing from that humanitarian aid container.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	So what if we acted like snitches. That man knew the risk.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We acted like a bunch of snitches. Disgraceful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Our neighbor put his trust in us, and we snitched to those rebel soldiers. We should be ashamed of ourselves.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	I hate those rebels as much as I hate the military! We shouldn't have cooperated with them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	By reporting our neighbor to those soldiers we at least saved our own skins and even got something out of it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	That neighbor knew the risk. Telling on him to those rebel soldiers was necessary to divert their attention from us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I feel dirty. We shouldn't have confirmed those soldiers' suspicions.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We betrayed our neighbor. Plain and simple.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I think we did the right thing by not reporting on our neighbor to those rebel soldiers, I just hope we don't get into trouble because of that.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/01	We sure could use whatever reward they were going to give us, but we aren't snitches, are we.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	There's no way we were going to snitch to those soldiers! Solidarity between neighbors is important!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We'd never betray our neighbor's trust. We're in this hell together, we have to help each other.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	I'm glad we denied those rebel soldiers' suspicions regarding our neighbour. They can go to hell!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	If we had confirmed those soldiers' suspicions, we could have profited. They said there was a reward.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	I hope covering our neighbor's ass doesn't get us into trouble.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Our neighbor trusted us and we did not fail him. He would surely do the same for us, wouldn't he?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	Between the rebels and the military, we have to stick together to survive. I'm glad we did not confirm those soldiers' suspicions regarding our neighbor.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Our neighbor was right to ask for our help. We will help make her house more secure.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I'm glad we decided to help our neighbor in need. Supporting each other is important.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Securing our neighbor's house is not our problem, ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have gone there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I'm not happy ^CharacterName^ went to spend the night at our neighbor's house, we need everyone to guard the shelter and scavenge.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Our neighbor looked really worried about her own and her daughter's safety. I'm glad we decided to help them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We couldn't leave our neighbor without help. She was really scared.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	How could we refuse to help our neighbor secure her house? She was so worried.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Without our help, our neighbor's house is much more vulnerable.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Securing our neighbor's house was not our problem. We needed every pair of hands here.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	I wouldn't be happy if someone had gone to our neighbor's house. We have our own problems here.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Our neighbor was worried about her own and her daughter's safety. I'm sorry we didn't help them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	How could we leave our neighbor without help? She was really scared.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	Unfortunately, those women had to seek help elsewhere.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We couldn't help those women board up their windows.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_03	We would've helped those women if we could.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I'm so relieved we agreed to help our neighbor in distress.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I feared we might not agree to help our neighbor in need. I'm glad we did.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	Those bandits need to be taught a lesson!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	If you ask me, we should care more about our own and less about other people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Was helping our neighbor necessary? I don't think so.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I'm not sure helping our neighbor is worth the risk.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	Was helping our neighbor necessary? I'm not sure.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I'm glad we decided to help protect our neighbor and her daughter against bandits.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	We just couldn't leave our neighbor in need. She was terrified.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/00	I hope nothing bad happened to our neighbour. Someone should've gone with her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruist/01	I'm really worried about our neighbor. We should have sent someone with her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Why didn't we help our neighbor in distress? Was it indifference or cowardice?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Our neighbor needed our help and we failed her. I hope she and her daughter are okay.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	We didn't help our neighbor, so what? We've got our own problems.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/01	Our neighbor needed help, but so do we. Is there anyone here to help us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I'm disappointed we didn't help protect our neighbor and her daughter against bandits.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_02	How could we leave our neighbor in need? She was terrified.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Generic_01	I couldn't leave the shelter to help protect my neighbors. Someone could've broken into my shelter and robbed me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	War drove ^CharacterName^ to take {mr|his}{fr|her} own life. Are we next?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	This is horrible! ^CharacterName^ committed suicide, {mr|he}{fr|she} couldn't take it anymore. I wish we could've done something.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ took {mr|his}{fr|her} own life. Maybe it's better this way. {mr|He}{fr|She} no longer has to suffer.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Regretfully, ^CharacterName^ committed suicide. Will we all be driven to that as well?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}. Maybe we should all do the same, that would be easier than having to endure this hell.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ committed suicide, leaving us on our own. It was a very tragic, yet very selfish act.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	That's a pity... ^CharacterName^ was one of us. It's our fault that {mr|he}{fr|she} couldn't take it anymore.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	Fuck! How could ^CharacterName^ leave us like that! We need every pair of hands!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ took the coward's way out. At least now we don't need to look after {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ committed suicide. I don't want to end up like that. I must get a grip.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ left us... {mr|He}{fr|She} won't survive alone, I'm afraid.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ left us last night... Even though {mr|he}{fr|she} took our things, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be alright.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	^CharacterName^ acted selfishly, but I still hope {mr|he}{fr|she} will make it out of Pogoren safely.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Damn it! ^CharacterName^ ran away with our supplies, it will be difficult to survive now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Without the supplies ^CharacterName^ took, we might not make it through.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	Where's ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} left us, leaving us almost nothing. Some friend!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	How could ^CharacterName^ be so false?! We trusted {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ fled with our supplies! How stupid! Only as a group do we stand any chances!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	How could ^CharacterName^ betray us like that?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	Fuck! ^CharacterName^ stole our supplies and ran away! I'll kill {mr|him}{fr|her} if I get the chance!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ stole our things and ran away! I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} dies!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ disappeared with our supplies! Could it get any worse?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	It was hard even when ^CharacterName^ was with us. And now {mr|he}{fr|she}'s gone, along with our supplies!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	We're better off without ^CharacterName^ anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ left us... I'm sure we had better chances together.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	If ^CharacterName^ prefers to be alone rather than with us, so be it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	^CharacterName^ left us? {mr|He}{fr|She}'d better not get us into trouble!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	We don't really need ^CharacterName^. We can make it through without {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	Now that ^CharacterName^ is gone, we can split {mr|his}{fr|her} share of supplies among us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Did ^CharacterName^ leave because we mistreated {mr|him}{fr|her}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	It's so sad when you realize that ^CharacterName^ is somewhere out there, all alone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I wish ^CharacterName^ good luck, but I'm afraid {mr|he}{fr|she} might not make it on {mr|his}{fr|her} own.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	I doubt ^CharacterName^ can make it on {mr|his}{fr|her} own.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Small wonder ^CharacterName^ left us. We didn't treat {mr|him}{fr|her} well.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	If I were ^CharacterName^, I'd leave too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I feel like scum. We should've treated ^CharacterName^ better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	We were unfair toward ^CharacterName^, and that's why {mr|he}{fr|she} left us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ ran away. Good riddance. Fewer mouths to feed.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I don't think ^CharacterName^ will survive without us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	We didn't do enough for ^CharacterName^, yet I don't think leaving us was a good decision.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	^CharacterName^ left us? Fuck it, we don't need {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ left. We'll get used to {mr|his}{fr|her} absence.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ was useful to us, too bad {mr|he}{fr|she}'s gone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	^CharacterName^ will come back, just wait and see.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	We failed ^CharacterName^, that's why {mr|he}{fr|she} left.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ wasn't good enough to be one of us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We should've treated ^CharacterName^ better. {mr|He}{fr|She} was one of us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	It's our fault ^CharacterName^ left us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	We shouldn't mistreat ^CharacterName^ like that...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I think we should be more fair toward ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ is one of us, we should treat {mr|him}{fr|her} better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	We shouldn't mistreat ^CharacterName^ like that, we're all in this together.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	Treat me fairly or I'm gonna beat you bloody!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	If I'm not treated fairly, I'll get really angry!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	They don't know what I'm capable of. If they keep mistreating me, they'll see.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Nobody cares about me, maybe I should just go outside and take a sniper's bullet.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'd like to know why I am mistreated. Did I do something wrong?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	I don't understand... Why am I treated like someone worse?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Why, when there aren't enough supplies for all of us, I am always the one left empty handed?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	If I'm not treated fairly, I'm gonna look for support elsewhere.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I thought we were a group, why am I being mistreated?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	We should share everything and stick together. Why am I being treated unfairly?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditsRobbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	Armed thugs have everything while decent people are left to scavenge and steal. That's so unfair.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditsRobbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	It was dangerous to steal from those thugs, but I made it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditsRobbed/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	It was a risky way of getting supplies. I hope it was worth it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditsRobbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	By stealing from those thugs, we did the city a favor.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditsRobbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I was worried about ^CharacterName^. Stealing from armed thugs is like playing dice with death.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditsRobbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ stole from those bandits. We'll make better use of their supplies than they would.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditsRobbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	If we need to steal to survive, I'd rather we would steal from thugs than innocent people. My only concern is that it's dangerous.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditsRobbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	They had been robbing helpless civilians. ^CharacterName^ managed to return the favor.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	Damn it, the military have food, meds, everything. And what do we have?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	They have everything while we have nothing. That's so unfair.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I'm glad I made it back alive, it was very risky to steal from soldiers.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	It's sad to see that soldiers who are trying to kill us are so well supplied.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	The army is well supplied while people in the city starve and die of diseases.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Stealing from soldiers was dangerous, but I feel satisfied. They shoot at us and our neighbors.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	It's a huge risk to steal from soldiers, but it might pay off.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ was lucky not to get killed by those soldiers.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I was worried about ^CharacterName^. The military are not to be trifled with.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back. It's a huge risk to steal from the army men.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/SoldiersRobbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Those soldiers won't even miss what ^CharacterName^ took, they have supply lines. We don't.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Soldierkilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I can't believe I managed to kill a soldier...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Soldierkilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I wonder if that soldier I killed has a family that will miss him...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Soldierkilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	I'm not proud of killing that soldier, yet my deed may have saved someone else. Maybe even our neighbors.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Soldierkilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I somehow managed to survive... but I'd rather not think how dangerous that was.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Soldierkilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ killed a soldier? Good.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Soldierkilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I wish ^CharacterName^ hadn't killed that soldier. Maybe he was drafted against his will?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Soldierkilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	It would have been better if ^CharacterName^ hadn't killed anyone, but maybe that soldier was one of those trying to kill us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Soldierkilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ made it back. Confronting a soldier was very risky.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I got one of those scumbags, but I can still hear my heart pounding.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I only hope that the thug's death saves other people's lives.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	That guy was a threat to us and our neighbors, I had to get rid of him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I managed to kill a bandit and come back alive, but it was very dangerous.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ killed a bandit? Good riddance. One scum less to take advantage of helpless people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm not sure what to think about ^CharacterName^'s deed. That guy was a bandit, but was killing him necessary?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ killed a bandit. We should show {mr|him}{fr|her} our support.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/BanditKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ could've got killed by that thug. I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} managed to come back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewSoldiersKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	One or more soldiers dead, what's the difference? They don't care how many of us they kill, either.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewSoldiersKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I couldn't avoid killing those soldiers. I'll have to live with that somehow.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewSoldiersKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Those soldiers were a threat to us all, something had to be done.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewSoldiersKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Killing soldiers is like playing with fire. If they find us, we're dead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewSoldiersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	How did ^CharacterName^ manage to kill those soldiers? I didn't know {mr|he}{fr||she} had it in {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewSoldiersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Yes, they were soldiers, yes, they were trying to kill us... But they probably had families, just like us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewSoldiersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Those soldiers were people like us, but they would've killed ^CharacterName^ all the same, had {mr|he}{fr|she} failed to kill them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewSoldiersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Let's not think about the lives ^CharacterName^ took, let's think about lives {mr|he}{fr|she} saved.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewBanditsKilled/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I'm still trembling, I'm lucky to have made it back alive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewBanditsKilled/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	At least those thugs won't bother anyone anymore. If only killing them had not been necessary.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewBanditsKilled/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Criminals thrive during wartime. At least those individuals are no longer a threat to anyone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewBanditsKilled/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	Encountering those bandits was fucking insane, but I somehow made it back alive.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewBanditsKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	The way {mr|he}{fr|she} handled those thugs... ^CharacterName^ is one tough cookie.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewBanditsKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Meeting those thugs must've been a horrible experience for ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewBanditsKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I'm glad we didn't lose ^CharacterName^. {mr|He}{fr|She} took a huge risk out there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/FewBanditsKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ survived {mr|his}{fr|her} encounter with those bandits.

UI/ScenarioEditor/LowDescription	The city is cut off, but the situation could be worse. The shortages of supplies are a problem, but not a drastic one yet. Crime is not rampant yet, as people still prefer to scavenge for supplies rather than rob others. People are hopeful, and neighbours often stick together and try to help one another.
UI/ScenarioEditor/MediumDescription	The situation in the city is severe. There are shortages of everything, and black market prices fluctuate. Bands of looters attack homes at night, as desperate people turn to crime to survive. People have some hope, but neighbours aren’t quick to help one another.
UI/ScenarioEditor/HardDescription	The ongoing siege means the situation in the city is dire. Even the most basic supplies are difficult to get. Black market prices skyrocket. Desperate people scour the streets and ruins clean of everything of any use. Bandits roam the city and nobody is safe in their home. People have little hope, and are unwilling to help one another.

LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_nu/Name	Abandoned Cottage
LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_nu/Description	A family barricaded themselves in this house, but despite their efforts looters got inside. It's been abandoned ever since. Still, we might find some useful things that the looters overlooked or left behind.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_nu/FirstEnterComment	The looters must've been in a hurry, there's still a lot of stuff left.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_nu/StoryItem_01	A family photo of parents and two daughters. Good thing the girls don't resemble their father. He looks like a bear.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_nu/StoryItem_02	A note that says:

"On the first day they robbed us. Two days later they murdered our girls. I shot every one of them. But I don't want to use the gun anymore, it's broken and buried in the backyard."

The next part looks shaky:

"If you're reading this - don't look for me."
LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_2_nu/Name	Shelled Cottage
LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_2_nu/Description	This neighborhood recently got shelled and many houses are still burning. People were fleeing for their lives in a hurry, so we may find some useful stuff there without meeting anyone.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_2_nu/FirstEnterComment	The house is still burning, is it safe to go inside?
LocationsTexts/001_scav_domekA_2_nu/StoryItem	One of the flyers dropped on the city. It reads:

"This is a zone of anti-terrorist operation. Persons remaining in the city will be treated as terrorist supporters. FOR YOUR OWN AND YOUR FAMILY'S SAFETY, LEAVE POGOREN IMMEDIATELY! The army guarantees you a safe passage."

Not many believed them after the atrocities they had committed.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_ruined_block/Name	Ruined Block of Flats
LocationsTexts/001_scav_ruined_block/Description	This block of flats has seen some heavy fighting. Most people had fled the area before the Vyseni rebels clashed there with the military. The battle is over now, and there should be many things left to scavenge, because people were leaving in a rush.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_ruined_block/FirstEnterComment	It's so empty and quiet here, it gives me the creeps.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_ruined_block/StoryItem	The baby carriage isn't empty. A few objects lie scattered inside - a rattle, a smiling red crab, well worn by baby teeth, a feeding bottle half-full of congealed mass that was probably a baby formula. Someone must have left in a terrible rush... or maybe didn't need them anymore.
LocationsTexts/002_scav_domek_petrolstation/Description	Before the war, you could have your car repaired there. It was a decent family business, run by an impulsive son and his elderly father. If they still live there, they might be willing to trade with us. Alternatively, we might find lots of useful parts there and maybe even some food.
LocationsTexts/002_scav_domek_petrolstation/Name	Garage
LocationsTexts/002_scav_domek_petrolstation/FirstEnterComment	I wonder if the owners are still around.
LocationsTexts/002_scav_domek_petrolstation/StoryItem	Someone scrawled on the wall:

"NO MORE HIDING
WE MEET IN HEAVEN"
LocationsTexts/003_scav_domekM_nu/Name	Small Apartment Building
LocationsTexts/003_scav_domekM_nu/Description	This old apartment building is owned by an elderly couple and their son. They are still around, somehow managing to fend off looters. They probably have supplies like food and meds but won't be willing to share them with us. We can try to steal or take them by force. Lock picks might come in handy.
LocationsTexts/003_scav_domekM_nu/Description_2	This old apartment building used to be owned by an elderly couple and their son, but they fled before the siege. There are rumors of some shady-looking, well armed individuals taking refuge there. We had better be careful if we decide to go there.
LocationsTexts/003_scav_domekM_nu/FirstEnterComment	It's the back of the building, I should be able to sneak in.
LocationsTexts/003_scav_domekM_nu/FirstEnterComment_2	I should be careful, the rumors about bandits might be true.
LocationsTexts/003_scav_domekM_nu/StoryItem_01	I found a 'to do' list. It must be a group with some crude regime. This point is interesting:

"Who's leaving booze behind the shitter?! Clean up the mess!"
LocationsTexts/003_scav_domekM_nu/StoryItem_02	They've taken down all the pictures, but left this one - with little girls on a beach. I don't wanna know the reasons.
LocationsTexts/004_scav_domek_coward_nu/Name	Decrepit Squat
LocationsTexts/004_scav_domek_coward_nu/Description	It's been inhabited by the homeless since long before the war. They've always been struggling with the lack of food and might not have survived the recent shortages. They shouldn't be a threat and we could find some useful things there.
LocationsTexts/004_scav_domek_coward_nu/FirstEnterComment	It was a ruin before the war. Now half of the city looks like this.
LocationsTexts/004_scav_domek_coward_nu/StoryItem_01	The letter says:

"Dearest Masha. I found shelter among the homeless. I am no longer a teacher or an artist - I am one of them now. There is not much food, so some of my friends already left us. But do not be worried, I too will seek more appropriate refuge as soon as I've finished my painting."
LocationsTexts/004_scav_domek_coward_nu/StoryItem_02	Someone probably painted this picture recently. There are rich-looking people sitting together in a littered, ruined building. A metaphor of some sort, I believe.
LocationsTexts/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/Name	Brothel
LocationsTexts/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/Description	If you want to get laid for a can of meat, this is the place. Mothers will do some really kinky stuff to get food for their children. It's a big building, well guarded by local thugs. They have plenty of goods and are eager to trade.
LocationsTexts/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/FirstEnterComment	It's my first time in this kind of place.
LocationsTexts/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/StoryItem	It's trash, mostly. Among it lie a fashionable handbag, torn as if someone had ripped it open, not sparing any thought to a damaged zipper, a tiny framed photo of a young man, and a pocket notebook. Whoever tossed these here wasn't their owner.
LocationsTexts/006_school/Name	Shelled School
LocationsTexts/006_school/Description	The school has been shelled several times. Unfortunately, most of the cellars have collapsed so it might be a good idea to bring a shovel and maybe some other tools. They say some homeless people have taken refuge inside the building.
LocationsTexts/006_school/FirstEnterComment	I heard they had classes when the shelling started. Poor kids...
LocationsTexts/006_school/StoryItem_01	I found a letter:

"Mom, it's terrible! A girl I knew was shot today by a man called Sniper! I can't believe I won't see her again. She was such a kind girl, what did she do to this Sniper? They turned off the electricity and the teacher said we would have to stay in school a little longer today. I don't know why, I want to see you and dad already. At least they promised to bring you this letter. Will you come and take me home?"
LocationsTexts/006_school/StoryItem_02	It's a note left for someone:

"I prepared this secret stash behind the fridge, like you asked. I already put some stuff there so you can see if it works for you."
LocationsTexts/006_school/StoryItem_03	There are a lot of propaganda leaflets. On one of them there's a symbol of a plane symbol and a message:

"DO NOT APPROACH INTERNATIONAL AID DROPS. IT MAY BE DANGEROUS. REPORT ALL DROPS TO THE NEAREST MILITIA OUTPOST!"
LocationsTexts/006_school/StoryItem_04	Seems that they are storing propaganda leaflets here. There are plenty in the boxes and on the floor.
LocationsTexts/006_school/Description2	This school was damaged by mortar shells. No classes held for a long time. Recently a group of rebel militiamen moved into the abandoned building. They might be willing to trade with us.
LocationsTexts/007_scav_domek_warehouse/Name	Warehouse
LocationsTexts/007_scav_domek_warehouse/Description	This used to be a warehouse of a big store. Currently it's used as a hideout by a group of armed thugs. We might find useful things there if we can sneak in, but it is very dangerous.
LocationsTexts/007_scav_domek_warehouse/FirstEnterComment	They've seen some armed individuals here, I'd better be careful...
LocationsTexts/007_scav_domek_warehouse/StoryItem	Someone wrote on the wall:

"We have to go find Lena. We'll be at the market every day at noon.
S+D"
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/Name	Ruined Villa
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/Description	They say some people still live there, against all odds. They must have some supplies stocked, like canned food and possibly bandages or medicines, but they don't want to trade. If we're desperate, we could try to steal from them.
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/Description_2	It's an old villa in a rich neighborhood. People say some deserters from the army chose it for their hideout. They might be dangerous and suspicious of strangers, but they probably have lots of supplies stocked, like military rations of canned food.
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/FirstEnterComment	They're lucky to stay in their own house despite the devastation.
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/FirstEnterComment_2	It can be very dangerous. Deserters are not disciplined soldiers.
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/StoryItem_01	A black and white picture of the owner's wife surrounded by burning candles. Did she pass away? I hope it was before the war and she was lucky not to be part of it.
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/StoryItem_02	It's some woman's diary. She writes a lot about a man called Emil. Apparently, he owns this house and she made friends with him while treating his wounds. After she moved in, he began to reconcile with his wife's death. At least these two found some consolation in this mess...
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/StoryItem_03_hostage	This must have been the owner of the house. Poor guy. It seems he starved to death.
LocationsTexts/009_scav_domekR_nu/StoryItem_04_ransom	It seems to be a ransom note:

"We've got your son locked up in his house. If you try to take the place, we'll kill him. If you don't bring the money, we'll kill him slowly. So you better hurry. Ten thousand or he's dead."
LocationsTexts/010_scav_domek_twin/Name	Semi-Detached House
LocationsTexts/010_scav_domek_twin/Description	Half of it is a ruin, but there are people living in the other half. Apparently, they aren't hostile and have a lot of stuff to barter, even food and meds. Let's remember to take something to trade if we're going to pay them a visit.
LocationsTexts/010_scav_domek_twin/Description_2	Half of it is a ruin, but there are people living in the other half. They don't seem friendly - at night you can sometimes hear shots fired from there. We could probably scour the abandoned part for supplies if we manage to sneak past the inhabited part.
LocationsTexts/010_scav_domek_twin/FirstEnterComment	The destruction is unimaginable. It's a miracle the other part still stands.
LocationsTexts/010_scav_domek_twin/FirstEnterComment_2	This is the part where the shots were coming from, I'd better be careful.
LocationsTexts/010_scav_domek_twin/StoryItem_01	A note:

"There's a hollow wall in the basement. Please, hide some supplies there in case we have to come back."
LocationsTexts/010_scav_domek_twin/StoryItem_02	The crude letters on the wall reads:

"Hana, Tomas and me moved in with uncle Radu. We buried mom in the yard. Take care daddy.
Petra"
LocationsTexts/011_scav_domek_armybase/Name	Military Outpost
LocationsTexts/011_scav_domek_armybase/Description	Those who aim at each other during the day, often trade with each other at night. These soldiers have a lot of goods and they're willing to trade, especially for alcohol or cigarettes, but be careful, you never know what to expect from them.
LocationsTexts/011_scav_domek_armybase/FirstEnterComment	I've lost track who's side they are on.
LocationsTexts/011_scav_domek_armybase/StoryItem_01	The first page from a letter:

“Mother told me you're thinking about joining the military. I have a story for you. Last week we caught a rebel girl - a sniper. The guys told me she had killed some kid, so they wanted to have a little fun with her. They tied her to a tree with explosives all over her. The fuse was long enough to give her time to reconsider her life."
LocationsTexts/011_scav_domek_armybase/StoryItem_02	The second page from a letter:

"It took about ten minutes before she blew up. You know what’s the worst part? Not the guts and the blood. The look on her face. Her face is like burnt into the back on my skull. I don't think it'll ever go away. You wanna seek some adventure in the military, right? I found none, brother. Only death and dirt.”
LocationsTexts/012_scav_domek_hotel/Name	Hotel
LocationsTexts/012_scav_domek_hotel/Description	A small yet luxurious hotel, previously owned by Pogoren Travel Agency. Presently occupied by some armed thugs. Screams are sometimes heard coming from the building. It's best to keep away from it.
LocationsTexts/012_scav_domek_hotel/FirstEnterComment	Once noble and bright, now a shadow of its former self. Like us.
LocationsTexts/012_scav_domek_hotel/StoryItem_03	These bodies... they are horribly mangled. These wounds were inflicted with extreme cruelty... Whoever did this must have been a deranged psychopath...
LocationsTexts/012_scav_domek_hotel/StoryItem_04	There is a note scraped on the wall:

"Every night I hear screams. I can't take it much longer. I dread the moment when they come for me. God save me, please!"
LocationsTexts/012_scav_domek_hotel/Description_2	Previously owned by Pogoren Travel Agency, this small yet luxurious hotel has long been abandoned. The looters have already taken most of the things of any value, but they could've missed something. Some harmless lunatic is said to be living there for the moment.
LocationsTexts/012_scav_domek_hotel/Description_3	Pogoren Travel Agency used to own this small yet luxurious hotel. The owners fled the City just before the siege, along with the foreign journalists who had been staying there. Someone moved in there recently, and spread the news that he was willing to barter. Maybe he has something useful to us?
LocationsTexts/012_scav_domek_hotel/StoryItem_Loner	"Do you want to know how to cheat death? I dug a grave for myself - my old self I mean. He's buried deep in the ground, next to this so-called Hotel. These sacred grounds purify and grant you a new life. One that cannot be seen by The Final Judge."
LocationsTexts/013_construction_site/Name	Construction Site
LocationsTexts/013_construction_site/Description_snipers	This abandoned construction site of a luxury residential area, which was to become the jewel of Pogoren, now serves the military snipers as a perfect vantage point, making it a dangerous place to visit. We could find some useful things there, left by construction workers and rebels who held it for some time before they were driven out.
LocationsTexts/013_construction_site/FirstEnterComment	The developer promised the apartments would be finished "no matter what"...
LocationsTexts/013_construction_site/Description_patrols	It was supposed to be a luxurious residential area and there was a great hype on apartments there, but the developers fled abroad when the war started. Recently, the military wrested control over this area from the rebels. We could scavenge whatever the rebels left behind, but there is a risk of encountering military patrols.
LocationsTexts/013_construction_site/StoryItem_deadbodies	The stench of decay is unbearable. These bodies must be months old, as they are falling apart. Some have bullet holes in their heads, but no other obvious signs of violence. Are they the rebels killed by the army? Prisoners shot by the rebels? Whoever did this tried to conceal the crime by flooding the basement, maybe they intended to collapse the building and bury evidence under the rubble.
LocationsTexts/013_construction_site/StoryItem_proclamation	A torn flyer entitled PROCLAMATION reads:

"...here in our ancient capital Vyseni are at home and will no longer abide the oppression! The Republic of Vysena with its capital in Pogoren and within borders according of the treaty of..."

Fuck all your treaties and proclamations.
LocationsTexts/014_old_couple/Name	Quiet House
LocationsTexts/014_old_couple/Description	It's in a housing estate that remains almost untouched. It's a calm area of little houses with porches and gardens. Most of those houses are still inhabited - people are trying to lead normal lives there. We've got nothing to look for there, unless we're willing to steal.
LocationsTexts/014_old_couple/FirstEnterComment	When this is over I'm gonna buy myself a house like this.
LocationsTexts/014_old_couple/StoryItem_01	There's a letter from "Grandpa Bernard" to Alen.

"We're happy to learn that you've come to like living with auntie. The war is not that bad, it's just not fun for children. In fact, they say it will be over soon, so don't worry about us. Grandma is feeling better. She asked me not to tell you, but she's saving some flour to make you those cookies you like! And as for me... well, I promise you to repair the swing when you are back."
LocationsTexts/015_violator/Name	Supermarket
LocationsTexts/015_violator/Description	This store supplied the whole neighborhood before the latter turned into a war zone. Since the area is under military control, it might be dangerous to do the groceries there. Still, it might be worth the risk as there should be a lot of goods left.
LocationsTexts/015_violator/Description2	This supermarket is located in the area remaining under military control, but people are still trying to scavenge it for supplies. We can expect to meet other scavengers there, so it's probably best not to get in their way. Some doors might still be locked, a crowbar could come in handy.
LocationsTexts/015_violator/FirstEnterComment	I wonder how much of the supply is left.
LocationsTexts/015_violator/FirstEnterComment_2	I'm not alone here.
LocationsTexts/015_violator/StoryItem_gov	A faded leaflet with skull and crossbones reads:

"DANGER! DO NOT TOUCH UNEXPLODED AMMUNITION!
Any weapons, ammunition or equipment left behind or unexploded may be booby-trapped. Do not touch anything. Do not risk severe injury or death.
REPORT ANY SUCH FINDS TO THE NEAREST ARMY OUTPOST"
LocationsTexts/016_sniper/Name	Sniper Junction
LocationsTexts/016_sniper/Name_2	Central Square
LocationsTexts/016_sniper/Description	The city center used to be beautiful, with parks, squares and monuments, surrounded by old buildings. Unfortunately, numerous incidents with civilians shot out there earned it the nickname: 'Sniper Junction'. We may find valuable things there, but it's very risky.
LocationsTexts/016_sniper/Description_2	The city center used to be beautiful, with parks, squares and monuments, surrounded by old buildings. The war has taken its toll on the area, but there is a marketplace where people come to barter. We might be able to get the stuff we need, provided we have something to trade.
LocationsTexts/016_sniper/FirstEnterComment	It used to be such a lively place... I miss those times.
LocationsTexts/016_sniper/FirstEnterComment_2	Trade goes on even during the war.
LocationsTexts/016_sniper/StoryItem_nobaby	Someone scribbled a note on a page from an old magazine:

"David, Eva, it's your neighbor Magda. Your baby is safe with me. If you're reading this, try to reach my brother's house (we visited him together last summer, remember?). Good luck."
LocationsTexts/016_sniper/StoryItem_deadguy	It's the man we've met before. He must've tried to cross the junction despite his wounds.
LocationsTexts/017_scav_domek_church/Name	St. Mary's Church
LocationsTexts/017_scav_domek_church/Description_faith	St. Mary's Church is still a place of meetings for the local community. Priest Olek is known for his charitable work and offering refuge to the poor. He might have something to give away or trade. The vestry behind the church is devastated and abandoned. We could find some useful materials there.
LocationsTexts/017_scav_domek_church/Description_2_bandits	St. Mary's Church is known for its charitable priest, Olek. Alas, the church has recently been devastated and Olek's fate is unknown. We can expect piles of rubble, so a shovel might come in handy. A group of armed men are said to occupy the vestry building now. Going there might be dangerous.
LocationsTexts/017_scav_domek_church/FirstEnterComment	When I was a child, I would come here with my parents.
LocationsTexts/017_scav_domek_church/StoryItem_dog	There's a mark on the wall, and a few words:

"Here lies Roxy, the best dog in the world"
LocationsTexts/018_hospital/Name	City Hospital
LocationsTexts/018_hospital/Description	It's been shelled several times, there was a fire and numerous bandit raids. And yet, it still operates. Some wards still admit patients and save lives, mostly thanks to doctor Jefimow, a renowned surgeon, who remains steadfast and keeps the others in line.
LocationsTexts/018_hospital/StoryItem_01	It's an excerpt from the damage report after one of the shellings:

"General Surgery - 32 patients. 3 killed, 12 wounded.
Neurology - 13 patients. 0 killed, 2 wounded.
Children's Ward - 34 patients. 32 killed, 2 wounded.
Intensive Care - 55 patients. 9 killed, 10 wounded."

Seems that the children's ward took the most damage.
LocationsTexts/018_hospital/FirstEnterComment	They say it still operates. Maybe it's just a rumor?
LocationsTexts/001_scav_cpn/Name	Looted Gas Station
LocationsTexts/001_scav_cpn/Description	This was one of the very first places people looted while fleeing from the city. There had been a few hour long ceasefire intended to clean the whole area from civillians, but it was broken. Many people died, though neither side claimed responsibility to this day. Despite heavy shelling of the whole district, the station is in a suprisingly decent shape. It may have been looted, but it might still be worth to check it out.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_cpn/FirstEnterComment	Looks like people had drained it dry, since it didn't blow up after the shelling
LocationsTexts/001_scav_cpn/StoryItem_01	There is a note under the table, not actually hidden, but it could be easily missed. From the style of handwriting you can tell it was written by a woman. In a hurry.

"Milosz
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I could not wait any longer. I hid some jewelery inside the books. Look for them in the basement, inside carton boxes behind the barred door. Use it. Stay alive. Please.

God bless you
I'm sorry"
LocationsTexts/001_scav_cpn/StoryItem_02	This poor man had been caught by the shelling. What was he doing here?
LocationsTexts/001_scav_cpn/StoryItem_03	On the fresh grave lies a carefully folded little origami flower and a ID of a man named Milosz
LocationsTexts/019_scav_oldtown/Name	Old Town
LocationsTexts/019_scav_oldtown/Description	The old town used to be a crucible of cultures, with its distinct mix of architectural styles and many great Grazni and Vyseni restaurants and pubs. Military positions in the overlooking mountains make it a dangerous place now, but if we take the risk we might find some supplies there.
LocationsTexts/019_scav_oldtown/FirstEnterComment	Hmm… It looks as though someone reinforced that house, but it seems empty now.
LocationsTexts/019_scav_oldtown/StoryItem_01	Reinforced door and recent boot prints indicate some people had chosen this building as their refuge, before it was hit by a shell.
LocationsTexts/019_scav_oldtown/StoryItem_02	Fresh leftovers from a meal suggest someone still lives here.
LocationsTexts/019_scav_oldtown/StoryItem_03	An unsent letter.

Dear Mother,
We’re all living under a lot of stress, but it seems Robert can’t cope with it anymore. His mind is breaking under the pressure. He’s becoming violent. Today he was very harsh with Tatiana, only because she drank one glass of water more than was her share. I’m afraid war might change him even further.

I’m not sure I can rely on him anymore. We’ll try to leave the city. I’ve already made some arrangements. Love, Nadia
LocationsTexts/019_scav_oldtown/StoryItem_04	Robert,
My dear brother, by the time you read this, we will have already gone. I know how much this house means to you, but we can’t go on living like this! Snipers, bandits, and now this explosion! I can’t convince you to leave, but you must understand I have to protect my little girl.

I’m leaving you some supplies in the box under the kitchen sink. You’ll also find some documents hidden under the stairs. They will help you leave the city if you decide to join us. Be safe. Nadia

Traders/BasicTrader/OfferedItemGrades/-2/00	You can have it almost for nothing.
Traders/BasicTrader/OfferedItemGrades/-1/00	It's quite common, being honest.
Traders/BasicTrader/OfferedItemGrades/1/00	It would cost you...

Traders/BasicTrader/AcceptedItemGrades/-2/00	Very common stuff, not very interesting.

Traders/BeggarFood/AcceptedItemGrades/0/00	It's very interesting but has no value for me...
Traders/BeggarFood/AcceptedItemGrades/1/00	Please, I'd be so grateful if I could have it...
Traders/BeggarFood/OfferGrades/1/00	You are a good person.
Traders/BeggarFood/OfferGrades/2/00	It's so much... Are you sure there will be enough left for you too?
Traders/WarriorFather/GreetingsSpeech/00	We're leaving soon, I need supplies for my family.
Traders/WarriorFather/GreetingsSpeech/01	The situation is uncertain, we may need to defend ourselves.
Traders/WarriorFather/GreetingsSpeech/02	It's not easy to get firearms, do you have some to trade?
Traders/KidnapersTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	Just shut up and trade.
Traders/KidnapersTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	This is the place to get the good stuff. Or to get laid.
Traders/KidnapersTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	Y'know how's life, we've gotta cope somehow.
Traders/ArmybaseTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	Hey, if you got smokes or booze, we'll make a deal. But don't try anything funny!
Traders/ArmybaseTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	Hey, you have something for trade, right? If not, beat it!
Traders/ArmybaseTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	We've got lot's of stuff to trade, but we lack booze and smokes. Got some?
Traders/ScrapTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	Hello, let's trade!
Traders/ScrapTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	I've got metal parts, scrap, whatever you need!
Traders/ScrapTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	Only finest wares. Check them out!

Traders/FoodTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	Canned meat, fresh meat, vegetables, you name it!
Traders/FoodTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	Get your food here. Good prices!
Traders/GreedyNurseTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	I've got medical supplies, get them while they're available.
Traders/GreedyNurseTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	You don't look so well, but I sure as hell have something to fix it.
Traders/GreedyNurseTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	Trust me, I used to be a nurse. I know my trade.
Traders/PriestTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	Welcome to the house of God. We are a peaceful community here.
Traders/PriestTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	Will you be so kind as to help the poor in time of hardship?
Traders/DefenderTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	Welcome! If you support the Vyseni liberation uprising, we can trade.
Traders/DefenderTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	We need guns and ammo most of all. What've you got?
Traders/DefenderTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	You can back our cause and profit at the same time!
Traders/ElectroTechTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	You need electrical appliances? Look no further!
Traders/ElectroTechTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	Got some really rare things, have a look!
Traders/ElectroTechTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	Let's make a deal, you won't regret it!
Traders/GenericTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	Hello, let's barter!
Traders/GenericTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	Come on, take a look at my wares.
Traders/GenericTrader/GreetingsSpeech/02	I'm sure I've got what you need!
Traders/WeirdoTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	Gimme your smokes, trust me you don’t wanna piss me off!
Traders/WeirdoTrader/OfferGrades/1/00	You’re a cool {mr|guy}{fr|gal}!
Traders/WeirdoTrader/OfferGrades/1/01	You’re lucky!
Traders/WeirdoTrader/EmptyTableSpeech/00	Give me those smokes you {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
Traders/WeirdoTrader/EmptyTableSpeech/01	Hand over the smokes or you’re dead!
Traders/WeirdoTrader/EmptyTableSpeech/02	Give me something to smoke or else!
Traders/WeirdoTrader/AcceptedItemGrades/1/00	Just what I need, hand it over!
Traders/HospitalTrader/GreetingsSpeech/00	Again, we mostly need medicines, bandages, and alcohol.
Traders/HospitalTrader/GreetingsSpeech/01	Our resources are modest, but we have some things to exchange.
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferedItemGrades/-2/00	This is very common, a symbolic contribution would be enough.
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferedItemGrades/-1/00	This? Surprisingly, we acquire it quite easily.
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferedItemGrades/1/00	You would have to offer us significant help.
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferedItemGrades/2/00	Oh, you need to make an extraordinary donation to receive it.
Traders/HospitalTrader/AcceptedItemGrades/-2/00	This is something you wish to donate to the hospital...? Really?
Traders/HospitalTrader/AcceptedItemGrades/-1/00	We can accept it, but we'd prefer medications or bandages.
Traders/HospitalTrader/AcceptedItemGrades/0/00	We won't need that.
Traders/HospitalTrader/AcceptedItemGrades/1/00	This will be useful for our patients.
Traders/HospitalTrader/AcceptedItemGrades/2/00	Exactly what we need. If you donate it, we can save more lives.
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferGrades/-2/00	Don't be ridiculous. Offer us something useful or leave.
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferGrades/-1/00	If you're into this kind of trade, you've come to a wrong place. Offer us more.
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferGrades/0/00	Sure, it's an honest exchange. Not necessarily an expected donation...
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferGrades/1/00	That's an offer I'd expect from a decent person!
Traders/HospitalTrader/OfferGrades/2/00	It'd be such a generous donation... I hope you won't change your mind.
Traders/HospitalTrader/EmptyTableSpeech/00	Do you want to make a donation to the hospital?
Traders/HospitalTrader/NoPlayerOfferSpeech/00	Show me how you want to help us.
Traders/HospitalTrader/NoTraderOfferSpeech/00	You can choose something for exchange... or just help the hospital.
CharacterBios/Marko/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	Everyone should choose one happy memory. And it can’t just be good, it has to be grand. When it gets so bad you just want to sit down and cry, when your life seems forfeit, you close your eyes and go back to your happy moment. It’s not easy, but you have to try.
CharacterBios/Marko/Story_Step_1/Trauma	My father told me that I should choose one happy memory. And when the life becomes miserable, I just have to close my eyes and go back to that happy moment. But what do you do when your happiest memory brings you nothing but pain?
CharacterBios/Marko/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	We were called to a tenement fire. I was still the new one on our team. We just started assembling the hoses, when a resident shouted that there was someone inside. I donned the mask, went in and carried out a young lady. Long story short, we got married soon after. Her name was Alina.
CharacterBios/Marko/Story_Step_2/Trauma	My happiest moment is a memory of a fire. I was a new addition to our team and guys used to tease me, calling me names, but it was a friendly ribbing. Long story short, we were called to a tenement fire and I got lucky, rescued a young lady and became the old hand right there. And that lady, Alina was her name, became my wife soon after.
CharacterBios/Marko/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	Alina gave me two beautiful girls. We were so happy. When the war broke out, we decided they would be safer at my mother’s house in the country. I stayed with my team to help people. We thought all this would be over in a couple of weeks. It’s been almost three years now. Phones are dead, so I’ve been sending letters through anyone leaving the city.
CharacterBios/Marko/Story_Step_3/Trauma	We had two kids, two beautiful daughters. When the war started, she took them and moved to the country, to my mother. She wanted me to come but I’d never leave my team in times like these. We had a lot of fires to fight. Then, there were more fires than we could fight... and later on the team was no more. It turned out I couldn’t leave the city.
CharacterBios/Marko/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	I’ve got no reply yet and I’m really worried. But I have to trust that Alina and the girls are fine and that everything is going to be alright, or I’ll go mad. When this siege is over, I'll find them no matter what and I won't let anything separate us ever again. I hope that one day we can forget this war ever happened and think of it as just a bad dream.
CharacterBios/Marko/Story_Step_4/Trauma	I've had no word from them for months now. There is no way to reach them, no phones, no mail, I’ve tried to give letters to strangers, but haven’t heard back. I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever see my Alina and my daughters alive. And this slowly drives me crazy. I wish I could get my hands on whoever started this madness.
CharacterBios/Marko/EndLog/Good	After the war, Marko found his family, who managed to avoid the worst atrocities hidden away by a friendly country family. They came back to Pogoren along with other people. Normalcy returned to the city. Buildings were rebuilt. Schools and shops reopened. Life went on.
CharacterBios/Marko/EndLog/Mixed	After the war, Marko set out to find his family. The refugees from the city had been brutally persecuted. Alina and the girls survived, but what they went through scarred them forever. Marko never spoke of the horrors he'd witnessed, either. Would life ever be normal again?
CharacterBios/Marko/EndLog/Bad	After the war, Marko set out to find his family. The refugees from the city had been brutally persecuted. There was no trace of Alina or the girls. Marko hoped against the odds they did not end up in one of the many mass graves scarring the countryside. Would he ever see them again?
CharacterBios/Marko/EndLog/DwellerDied	For all his efforts Marko was rewarded with a shallow grave. Maybe his wife and daughters will find it someday, on condition that they managed to survive the persecutions themselves.
CharacterBios/Marko/EndLog/DwellerRejected	It was a tough decision but there were reasons why Marko could not stay in the shelter.
CharacterBios/Marko/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Marko slipped out of the shelter one night, leaving no notes behind. He died, betrayed by a smuggler, while trying to reach his family.
CharacterBios/Marko/EndLog/Suicide	Broken, Marko lost all hope of ever reaching his wife and daughters. Along with hope, he also lost his will to live on. He left them a goodbye letter, but no one passed it on to them.
CharacterBios/Marko/Bio	I thought I'd been through hell before. I'm a fireman. I’ve entered blazing buildings to save lives more times than I care to remember. But back then I had people teamed up against a common foe, namely the fire. Nowadays, your former neighbor can kill you because your grandparents spoke a different language than his. This is true hell on earth.
CharacterBios/Marko/DwellerCandidate	Sorry to disturb you, funny how life turns out. I'm a fireman, I've been saving people all my life. Now I'm the one that needs saving. My family fled to the country. I wanted to go to them, but the city got encircled and I couldn't. Will you let me stay with you?
CharacterBios/Marko/DeathNote	It’s Marko’s body. He used to save people’s lives and now he lies dead and abandoned. He deserved better.
CharacterBios/Marin/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	People treasure their possessions now. In the past, they just tossed out anything that broke. I had a hard time living off my workshop, customers were dropping by once or twice a day, mostly like that old lady who had been using the same iron since she was a young bride and the world was brighter... But there were exceptions.
CharacterBios/Marin/Story_Step_1/Trauma	People value their things now. And they used to dump all that broke into the trash! I ran a repair business, but I couldn't make a good living with just a couple customers a day. Mostly old women who would use the same meat grinder all their life if only they could. Not that I complain. Wouldn't see much business otherwise.
CharacterBios/Marin/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	One day a little boy brought his action figure with a broken arm. You can't glue that kind of plastic. Oh my, I said, this is serious, and his eyes welled up and I had no heart to turn him down, so I just told him to return the next day. I fixed it - trade secret - and when he saw it, his smile lit up the whole room. I don't know what became of him. The toy I found in the street after all went to hell.
CharacterBios/Marin/Story_Step_2/Trauma	One day a kid brought an action figure with a broken arm. They make them from plastic that can't be glued. And there are no spare parts. All on purpose, to sell more new toys. But I fixed it anyway! And gave it back to the boy. Oh, how happy he was. Later, after everything went to hell, I found his toy in the street. And I knew... I knew he wouldn't part with it for his life.
CharacterBios/Marin/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	I was asked to make a set of burglary tools. I refused. Money was good, but I wanted none of it. I wish I knew those customers wouldn't take 'no' for an answer. They came for me when I was upstairs with my wife, fast asleep. I figure they couldn't force the shop door, so they just tossed a Molotov through the window. Our bedroom window.
CharacterBios/Marin/Story_Step_3/Trauma	I was asked to make a set of burglary tools. I refused. Money was good, but I wanted none of it. I should have taken the job.
When the thugs came for me, we... I was upstairs, fast asleep, and the shop door was locked. I know my doors and my locks, so they just tossed a Molotov through the bedroom window.
CharacterBios/Marin/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	I don't even know how I escaped. My wife didn't. All I cared about was burned to the ground. Every now and then I think about that boy. Where is he now? What is he doing? Is he still alive? If he is, I'm gonna find him one day. I'm sure he misses his toy.
CharacterBios/Marin/Story_Step_4/Trauma	The flames were everywhere. I grabbed the sheets and tried to, tried to, you know. Smother the fire. But her hair - everything was burning. Everything was burned down. I escaped. I don't know how. I wish I had taken that job.
CharacterBios/Marin/EndLog/Good	Surviving the war, Marin set about finding the boy who once brightened his day. His efforts proved futile so he rebuilt his house and kept the action figure in the shop window.
And one winter afternoon, the entrance bell rang and the familiar smile has once again filled Marin's workshop - and his life - with light.
CharacterBios/Marin/EndLog/Mixed	Marin cheated death again and saw the end of fighting. Although he remained plagued by the survivor's guilt, he set about rebuilding his life and soon he was running a small repair business, again. He kept the action figure on his workbench but never found the courage to look for its previous owner.
CharacterBios/Marin/EndLog/Bad	Marin survived, but scarred for life, and not just physically. He opened a small repair business in a rented basement, sleeping under the workbench. Soon, he was booted out for lagging with his rent as he kept spending all income on booze. He died in a hospice of liver failure.
CharacterBios/Marin/EndLog/DwellerDied	These hardened hands will never again make anything right; neither for Marin, nor for anyone else. The tragic story of this man came to an end. Maybe he finally found peace.
CharacterBios/Marin/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Marin had to seek luck elsewhere, however useful he might have turned out to be.
CharacterBios/Marin/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	One night, Marin left the shelter, taking the action figure he had mentioned with him. He disappeared without a trace.
CharacterBios/Marin/EndLog/Suicide	Having lost everything, overcome by grief and remorse, Marin committed suicide. He was buried in a shallow grave like so many other victims of war.
CharacterBios/Marin/Bio	Something broke? I can fix it. Any worthless trash lying around? I can make plenty of useful stuff out of junk. And I don't waste material - all of them... parts, bits of wood, plastic pipes... and all the other... things. I know how to make tools, furniture, stoves, heaters, whatever. Given enough time, I can make this place look almost like a proper home. I wish it was equally simple with mine.
CharacterBios/Marin/DwellerCandidate	My name is Marin. I ran a repair workshop, but it was burned down. I have nothing to go back to... Maybe I could stay here with you? I'm handy with all kinds of tools. If you have some junk lying around, I could use it to make this place more habitable.
CharacterBios/Marin/DeathNote	Marin’s body… There’s no time to bury him now, but I’ll remember this place. Maybe after the fighting is over, I’ll come back here.
CharacterBios/Roman/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I was at the front line since the shit got serious. My unit was always the first to go in and the last to get out. After I lost a quarter of my men, the elders decided we needed some R&R. That's how I wound up in Pogoren, where all was quiet. It was not to last.
CharacterBios/Roman/Story_Step_1/Trauma	Ever since the fighting started, I was in the thick of it with my unit. The assholes from the HQ let us rest only when a quarter of my people were dead. And they sent us to Pogoren of all places, where soon the carnage was worse than at the front line.
CharacterBios/Roman/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	The battle for Pogoren was short and ugly. When the man in the street can turn out to be the enemy, people start... taking precautions. Like shooting anyone who looks at them funny. I'm not saying I did that, but I was the minority.
CharacterBios/Roman/Story_Step_2/Trauma	The worst thing about the fights in Pogoren was that you never knew if the man whom you passed in the street wasn't working for the enemy. So I told my men to be extra suspicious. Better to shoot one more guy than let the fucker turn around and stab you in the back.
CharacterBios/Roman/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	After we finished carving up the city between ourselves and the enemy, things got even uglier. Entire groups of civilians were brought in for questioning and much too often shot so as not to leave witnesses behind, I guess. I wanted no part of that. I'm a fighter, not a murderer.
CharacterBios/Roman/Story_Step_3/Trauma	After the borders between our turf and the enemy's were more or less stable, things got even uglier. Entire groups were rounded up and some people shot after having been interrogated. One day we were ordered to dispose of a bunch of such poor bastards. I recognized one of them. It was Leon, my best childhood buddy. I aimed over their heads. Others didn't.
CharacterBios/Roman/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	One night I changed into my old garb and just walked away. My mate was on duty, I told him I'm off to get some ass and I'd be back by dawn. I hope he didn't catch too much shit for letting me through.
CharacterBios/Roman/Story_Step_4/Trauma	After that, I couldn't look my people in the face. I wanted to kill them, or kill myself, or blow up the whole compound. I ended up just running away one night.
I have no idea what I'll say if I ever meet them. I don't know if I was too weak, or if they were.
CharacterBios/Roman/EndLog/Good	After the war, Roman sought out his former buddies and much to his great relief learnt that most of them admired his courage and the decision he made. He returned to his neighborhood and became a leader of the local community.
CharacterBios/Roman/EndLog/Mixed	Roman survived the war but avoided his old haunts, anxious to meet former comrades. He settled in the country and tried to start a new life, but remained haunted by his past.
CharacterBios/Roman/EndLog/Bad	Roman survived the war. Tortured by his past, he started doing hard drugs and a few years later died of drug-related health problems.
CharacterBios/Roman/EndLog/DwellerDied	As so many other tough-as-nails guys, Roman didn't make it. His motivations will remain unknown to his buddies, and some of them still think he betrayed them.
CharacterBios/Roman/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Roman had to seek shelter elsewhere. His military background was deemed more of a problem than an asset.
CharacterBios/Roman/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Roman disappeared from the shelter one night, leaving no note. He survived the war but was soon arrested for murder and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.
CharacterBios/Roman/EndLog/Suicide	Unable to accept the reality in which he had to live, hating himself for not being stronger and more in control of his life, Roman killed himself. He left no notes or goodbye letters.
CharacterBios/Roman/Bio	I never thought I'd end up running and hiding from my buddies. But that's how things turned out. We were like brothers, and now I'm a dead man to them. My crew had ruled the 'hood since we were teens until just before the war. Then some of us got drafted, like my best friend Leon, others like me volunteered for the militia. It was going to be the ultimate showdown and every single one of us wanted a piece of the action.
CharacterBios/Roman/DwellerCandidate	Thanks for opening the door. I'm looking for a place to hide away for some time. I was drafted by the rebels, but I didn't want to kill my brothers, so I ran away at first opportunity. If they catch me, I'm dead. Let me stay with you!
CharacterBios/Roman/DeathNote	Roman was the toughest among us, but that wasn’t enough. What chances do I stand without him?
CharacterBios/Boris/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I had a beautiful girlfriend, Ana. We had a kid. A wonderful son. Luka was just like me, he was only seven and already stronger than all the other kids. I bet he would've grown up to become a great weightlifter, as I always wanted to be. If I had saved him.
CharacterBios/Boris/Story_Step_1/Trauma	I had a beautiful girlfriend, Ana. We had a kid. His name was Luka. He was going to be just as strong as me. But she used to pamper him too much. Boys should be brought up tough or they'll turn out soft. Or worse.
CharacterBios/Boris/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	When we were hiding in the basement, after they hit our house, we quickly ran out of food and had very little water. I could not move much because of my foot, Ana saved us both. She was a great mother, a real hero. Ana used to go out at night and she was bringing us everything we needed.
CharacterBios/Boris/Story_Step_2/Trauma	My house was hit and we had to live in the basement. We were hungry, we had very little water. I couldn't do anything, my foot was crushed, and I felt so useless. Ana kept disappearing every night and as I lay there in pain, with Luka in my arms, I couldn't help wondering where she was getting the food she was bringing us.
CharacterBios/Boris/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	Ana was a terrific mother. She'd do anything for Luka. I mean, she did, when he got the runs from bad water he drank. Soon he was weakening by the hour, so she went to get him the medicine. "You stay here, you can barely walk, and I'll run like the wind", she told me. But you can't outrun a sniper's bullet.
CharacterBios/Boris/Story_Step_3/Trauma	One day Luka fell ill with the runs, turned out he'd drunk water from a puddle. "I'm sorry daddy, I ate peanuts and I was terribly thirsty". Salted peanuts. This is not proper food for a child. Soon, he was getting weaker by the hour. Ana said she'd get him meds. She must've felt guilty for she didn't bother to wait for the sunset before she went out.
CharacterBios/Boris/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	A stranger came to our basement. He told me that Ana had been shot on the way back. He brought the meds, but it was too late for my poor son. "Don't cry daddy, I'll be fine now! And mum promised to bring us something nice", said Luka shortly before dying. I didn't tell him she was gone. I would give everything to bring them back. I'll always love them.
CharacterBios/Boris/Story_Step_4/Trauma	On the night of Luka's death some guy appeared out of nowhere and said that he was Ana's friend and that she had asked him to bring us the medicine. But it was too late for Luka. Before leaving, this guy said that Ana had been shot by a sniper... but I will always wonder if she didn't just choose a better life over us.
CharacterBios/Boris/EndLog/Good	Boris won over everything that war threw at him and used his grit and strength to help others rebuild their lives. The memory of Ana's sacrifice and Luka's faith supported him till the end of his days.
CharacterBios/Boris/EndLog/Mixed	Boris managed to see the end of war and tried to put his life back together, mostly to no avail. The memory of his son's and girlfriend's fate haunted him till the end of his days.
CharacterBios/Boris/EndLog/Bad	While Boris survived the war, he grew increasingly hateful towards others and spent several years on futile search for the sniper who shot Ana. He died from the injuries suffered in drunken altercation with a man he accused of being her killer.
CharacterBios/Boris/EndLog/DwellerDied	Luck has finally abandoned Boris, not much of a surprise for him. His strength was not enough to keep him alive. In a just universe, he'd be with his son now.
CharacterBios/Boris/EndLog/DwellerRejected	We decided that we couldn't accept Boris after all. Let's hope he had better luck elsewhere.
CharacterBios/Boris/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Boris disappeared one night without a trace. He died of liver failure a few years after the war.
CharacterBios/Boris/EndLog/Suicide	Boris couldn't take it anymore and took his own life, haunted by the memory son's and girlfriend's fate. Maybe he is reunited with them now.
CharacterBios/Boris/Bio	I'm not big with words. I'm just a regular guy, I used to stack stuff on the night shift at a warehouse, by hand mostly. It was tough work but I was always strong, even when I was a kid. Now this place is gone, shelled to hell, and so is my house. My foot was crushed under the rubble. It has healed, but it's still a bit stiff, so I can't run very fast. But I can carry more than anyone I know.
CharacterBios/Boris/DwellerCandidate	My neighborhood got shelled while I was working on a night shift at a local warehouse. I helped clear the rubble and get the survivors out, but we couldn't save everyone... When I got home I found it in ruins. Can I stay with you for some time? Looks to me you could use a pair of strong hands.
CharacterBios/Boris/DeathNote	Poor Boris… He really was an unhappy man. Maybe it’s better for him that way. Still, I will miss him.
CharacterBios/Arica/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I told you about my old man - I hated that asshole... But war does things to people. That night, when the bombs fell on Gravia, something changed. What he did… I’ll never forget it. You heard what they did in Gravia, right?
CharacterBios/Arica/Story_Step_1/Trauma	I made it all the way from Gravia to Pogoren, and for what? More shelling, more bloodshed. Maybe it would've been better if I'd died there and then. You heard what the Grazni did in Gravia?
CharacterBios/Arica/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	On that night I got a shrapnel in my thigh. The army entered the city and indiscriminately started slaughtering rebels and civilians. We had to scram and I couldn't even rise from my bed. So I was just lying there, waiting for death to come. I was hoping the old drunk would save himself, not stay with me till the end. Why worry about something you can't change?
CharacterBios/Arica/Story_Step_2/Trauma	After several hours of bombing the town, the military stormed the city and started slaughtering rebels and civilians like cattle. Wounded by a shrapnel, I couldn't run. Couldn't even walk. I was sure my old man would leave me behind. The asshole never cared about me anyway. Why would he, all of a sudden?
CharacterBios/Arica/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	He carried me out of the city. He walked all night. We flowed with a terrified crowd. Father carried me all the way. I have no idea where that old alcoholic found the strength. The day broke and he was still carrying me. When we got here, he just dropped to his knees and died. I will always remember the last words he whispered.
CharacterBios/Arica/Story_Step_3/Trauma	Without saying a word he lifted me up, and started walking. He walked all night like that. Grim, determined, silent. The sun rose and he kept on walking. Where did he even get the strength for that? Beats me. But he carried me all the way to Pogoren. And as soon as we got here, he collapsed to the ground and died. Was it worth it?
CharacterBios/Arica/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	He'd always been rough, never said what lay heavily on him, but at that moment he broke. - 'You have to make it, kid' - he said right before he died. - "You gotta be tough, all that's bad will end someday." - He looked at me, pleading. "Like me."
CharacterBios/Arica/Story_Step_4/Trauma	He carried me here and left me alone. We never talked much, he always kept his thoughts to himself. You know what he said right before he died? - "This is the last time anyone ever helped you, kid. You're on your own now."
CharacterBios/Arica/EndLog/Good	After the war Arica gave her father a symbolic funeral, and kept his picture. Despite the horrors she witnessed, she managed to start a family and tried to be a better parent than her father had been.
CharacterBios/Arica/EndLog/Mixed	Arica survived the war, though remained mistrustful of others. The horrors she'd witnessed made it difficult for her to find friends. She was afraid of starting a family, not believing she'd make a good parent.
CharacterBios/Arica/EndLog/Bad	Although Arica survived the war, she found it difficult to adjust to normal life. She did not trust anyone and relied only on herself. Presently, she is serving a sentence for burglary.
CharacterBios/Arica/EndLog/DwellerDied	Tough girl as she was, Arica died. Harsh reality of living in a ghetto could not be compared to the horrors of war. What would have become of her if she'd survived? We will never know.
CharacterBios/Arica/EndLog/DwellerRejected	We decided that Arica couldn't stay with us. We would be better off without her.
CharacterBios/Arica/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Arica left the shelter without a word. She resurfaced later on as a juvenile gang leader.
CharacterBios/Arica/EndLog/Suicide	Troubled Arica couldn't take it anymore and killed herself. It turns out she was much more sensitive and fragile than she showed.
CharacterBios/Arica/Bio	I'm a simple girl from the hood, and I know life. Street raised me more than my father did. That old sot beat me whenever he felt like it and knew how to make it hurt. That's all over now, he bit the dust in the first days of the war. I've been a cat burglar since I turned 14, you know how it is. I'm better at it than anyone you know and I can sneak like a fox. You'd be a fool kicking me out.
CharacterBios/Arica/DwellerCandidate	Hey, what's up? Nice place you got here. I'm looking for some place to lay low for a while. I used to live in a large block of flats till it got shelled. Here's the deal: you let me stay here, I help you out. I can move as quiet as a cat.
CharacterBios/Arica/DeathNote	Arica claimed to be as quiet as a cat, or was it a fox? Anyway, apparently that wasn’t enough to save her.
CharacterBios/Cook/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I used to be an optimist - one of those people who'd have sworn that war wouldn't come. Wars happened far away, in third-world countries. Or so I thought. Even when I was listening to the news getting scarier day by day, I did not believe all that was about to happen.
CharacterBios/Cook/Story_Step_1/Trauma	People are fools, but I was their king. I used to think that whatever our differences, we won't just start shooting each other one day. That it's something... other peoples do. Not us! We lived together for centuries, we are a civilized nation. Stupidity is lethal. Mine probably killed my dearest friend.
CharacterBios/Cook/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	I have a dearest friend who always worried a lot. One day she called me, terrified, saying there was a riot outside, the secessionists were inciting the crowd to burn the town hall. I told her not to worry. And I was right! Nothing came of it - this time. But even when the riots and fights became everyday news, I kept assuring her it would all blow over soon.
CharacterBios/Cook/Story_Step_2/Trauma	I answered the phone one day, and it was my friend, incoherent, crying that there was a crowd outside her house and how they were going to burn everything and she had to flee the country. I calmed her as well as I could - fortunately, the crowd dispersed soon - and I kept soothing her fears in the coming weeks. Did a really good job with that. She decided to stay.
CharacterBios/Cook/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	I have a house just outside the city and ride a bus to work. One day I was in my restaurant here in Pogoren, not really noticing the muted TV showing some scenes of heavy fighting - and suddenly I recognized the location. It was my town. My friend was there. With pounding heart, I grabbed my coat and rushed towards the sounds of gunfire.
CharacterBios/Cook/Story_Step_3/Trauma	I was in my restaurant, watching the patrons argue over their dinner and not really noticing the news showing some heavy fighting, when it hit me: they're showing Pogoren outskirts! It's my town! Where my friend lives! I don't know what I was hoping for when I rushed out the door and to the bus station.
CharacterBios/Cook/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	At the bus station I learnt from the other commuters that we were under siege, and no bus towards my town would leave. I was shattered. If it wasn't for me, my friend would've left the town and gone abroad to her aunt. But I convinced her to stay. And now... Now I don't know if she's well, I haven't heard from her ever since the siege began...
CharacterBios/Cook/Story_Step_4/Trauma	It was too late. The siege was on, we were already cut off, all rides to my town were cancelled. And it was also too late to do anything for my friend, anyway. I should've had thought about that before I lulled her into a false sense of security. I don't know what happened to her. Most likely I'll never learn, but I fear the worst.
CharacterBios/Cook/EndLog/Good	After the ceasefire Bruno set off looking for his friend. Her neighborhood saw heavy fighting and the majority of housing had been reduced to ruins, but she found shelter in the basement which somehow held. Despite the hardships she managed to survive and was happy to see Bruno alive as well. They remain friends to this day.
CharacterBios/Cook/EndLog/Mixed	After the ceasefire Bruno went looking for his friend. Her neighborhood saw heavy fighting, and most of the houses had been reduced to ruins, but she found shelter in the basement which held. Eating rats and scavenged scraps of food, she somehow managed to survive. Bruno felt responsible for her misery. He has never forgiven himself.
CharacterBios/Cook/EndLog/Bad	After the ceasefire Bruno went looking for his friend. Her neighborhood witnessed heavy fighting, and most of the houses had been reduced to ruins. She was nowhere to be found and her former neighbors did not know what had happened to her. Bruno never saw her again.
CharacterBios/Cook/EndLog/DwellerDied	Despite his valiant struggle, Bruno didn't make it through the war. The fate of his friend he was worried about remains unknown.
CharacterBios/Cook/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Bruno was denied refuge in the shelter. His fate beyond that day remains unknown.
CharacterBios/Cook/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Bruno left the shelter one night. He was trying to reach his friend and got shot while attempting to slip between army pickets.
CharacterBios/Cook/EndLog/Suicide	After having lost all hope, Bruno tied the noose around his neck. His last thoughts were of his lost friend, and of what could have been but wasn't meant to be.
CharacterBios/Cook/Bio	Before the war I used to own a restaurant. I even had my own TV show: "Bruno's Cuisine", I'm sure you've seen it. I visited beautiful places where I was filmed cooking exquisite dishes. All that seems of no importance now, don't you think? Nowadays, you're lucky if you get your hands on some canned meat or a bag of rice. And who knows how long this war is going to last.
CharacterBios/Cook/DwellerCandidate	Ok, I won't lie to you, I'm looking for a place to stay until this madness is over. Before the war I was a chef, I even had my own TV programme for some time. Now I'm penniless and homeless. If you let me stay, I can cook for all of us.
CharacterBios/Cook/DeathNote	Maybe Bruno wasn’t the kindest person I knew, but we were in this together and now he’s dead…
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I'm so glad to be here. I apologize for my introductory tirade. But this war has taken a heavy toll on my mind. Some people who are... who were very dear to my heart gave me an order to stay alive at all costs. And since I owe them my life, it's no longer mine to throw away.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Story_Step_1/Trauma	It's good to live under a roof, if a leaky one. I apologize for my tirade. But please understand, I was planning to walk out on the street in broad daylight and wait for the bullet, had I been alone a day longer. After all I that saw I'm just tired of trying to stay alive.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	I was factually precise about my status in the academia. I was nominated for the Fields Medal once - it's like the Nobel Prize in mathematics. I'm... I used to teach and enjoyed it quite a lot.
This, in turn, is in a way responsible for the impact the war had on me. I was trying to protect my brightest students for months, only to become a witness to them being killed ruthlessly.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Story_Step_2/Trauma	I used to teach young people mathematics. It's hard to find more useless skill to have in times like these. But I know how to set a trap and cook a rat! Not a day without learning something, as I used to say to my students. They are all gone... slaughtered like cattle, or worse, for you don't terrorize animals before slaughter. It spoils the taste.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	After the destruction of the campus, I hid with my students in abandoned houses on the riverfront. We managed to survive there for a while, hunting rats for food. We punched passages in the basement walls to move from house to house safely, as the shelling and snipers were unrelenting. But the damp darkness and constant fear of being buried alive drove some brilliant minds into insanity.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Story_Step_3/Trauma	After the destruction of the university, we ran and hid. We lived in basements for endless months. We crawled through dark passages and hunted vermin to delay starvation. I saw my pupils go mad from fear, lack of hope, and deprivation. We huddled together in cellars like worms under a stone, listening to the roar of explosions, waiting for the merciful death.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	The army swept through the neighborhood, going from cellar to cellar, pulling people out, shooting some on the spot, the young men especially, as "terrorist supporters". The girls were taken away. My students covered me with mattresses and ordered me to stay put. "Please, this once, professor, you must listen to us", they said. I didn't find it in me to protest.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Story_Step_4/Trauma	Finally, the army came and swept us from our hiding holes like rats. My best student Niko, who was supposed to be in Oxford this spring, was shot as a "terrorist supporter". The cries of girls being taken away will always ring in my ears. It is the cruelest irony to be the only survivor when everyone I vowed to nurture and protect is gone.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/EndLog/Good	While war left deep marks on Anton's character, he returned to teaching with newfound determination. And while too old for the Fields Medal, he's still eligible for the equally prestigious Abel Prize.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/EndLog/Mixed	Anton managed to stay alive but war scarred him for life. He never again found the courage to attach emotionally to anyone and devoted himself entirely to the pursuit of abstract knowledge.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/EndLog/Bad	After the war, Anton put his brilliant mind to the singular task of ensuring his own safety. He left the country and the pursuit of knowledge. He works now as an analyst for a large investment bank.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/EndLog/DwellerDied	Anton will never get his award. Despite his students' sacrifice, he did not manage to survive. The theorems he could prove, the students he could lead and inspire – all gone.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/EndLog/DwellerRejected	It's a pity but Anton had to seek shelter elsewhere. Who needs a scientist when we can die tomorrow?
CharacterBios/Matematyk/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	One night, Anton waited patiently for the right moment and slipped out the door unnoticed. His further fate is unknown.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/EndLog/Suicide	Even great minds can break under pressure. Consumed by guilt, Anton chose to take his own life. The sacrifice of his students was in vain.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/Bio	I've been running into either insufferable rubes or outright criminals. But I feel that you're different! And for a scientist with an established position like me, the company of people of comparable mental capacity is paramount. Besides... ah, bloody hell, I can't stand faking it anymore! I'm just an old fart who knows nothing. I'm so grateful for your company. I've been out there alone for too long. Way too long.
CharacterBios/Matematyk/DwellerCandidate	Good day, my name's Anton. Forgive me this intrusion... You see, I am not so young anymore, and frankly I don't think I can survive this war on my own. Would you be so kind as to let me stay with you? I promise I'll work to earn my keep!
CharacterBios/Matematyk/DeathNote	Maybe he was a famous mathematician, but for me he was a good companion. We were in this together, and now he’s dead.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	We lived in an expansive villa, with spacious bright rooms and large windows. To protect ourselves from stray bullets and splinters, we installed a double bed and a small heater in a cozy dressing room on the ground floor. We spent most of our time there, talking, reading, listening to music and playing games to stave off boredom.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Story_Step_1/Trauma	We lived in a large standalone house, whose spacious bright rooms with large windows became uninhabitable due to constant shooting and shelling. That is why we confined ourselves to one windowless dressing room on the ground floor which could hardly fit one double bed and a small heater. We spent most of our time there, going out only to the toilet.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	When the banks closed, father opened the safe box and pulled out a small chest. "Cheer up, girls", he said, "we aren't broke yet!" Then he went to the marketplace and brought back fresh peaches. He kept trading jewelry for food every day. We also received humanitarian aid, like everybody else. So it wasn't bad, apart from the isolation. But father wanted us to be safe.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Story_Step_2/Trauma	Father went to the marketplace every day to barter our deceased mother's valuables for food and other necessities. He also took humanitarian aid, though it must have been humiliating for him. My sister and I hardly went out at all. He wanted to keep us safe. Because we had long hair and no running water, we started having problems with lice.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	One day father was unwell, so I went to the market instead. I was happy to finally be out in the open. I had the safe route memorized, so I made the trip safely. But coming back, I saw a column of smoke over our street. Our house was on fire. I couldn't get inside, the smoke was too thick. I went around to the garden entrance and there I found them.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Story_Step_3/Trauma	One day father fell ill, so I had to go to the market. My fears proved unfounded, as nothing bad happened to me on the way. But when I was coming home, I saw smoke over our street. Our house was on fire. I couldn't get inside, the smoke was too thick. Dreading the worst, I started calling my father and sister. Nobody answered. Then I found them in the backyard.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	My father and sister were shot dead. Some ragtag militiamen entered the house claiming they were looking for enemy informants. They took my father and sister to the garden and shot them. The neighbors said that they didn't even bother to interrogate anyone. Instead, they had cleaned the house of anything valuable.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Story_Step_4/Trauma	My father and sister were dead. The neighbors told me that the militia members entered the house claiming they were looking for Grazni informants. They interrogated and killed my family and before setting fire to the house, they took everything valuable that was still there. I'm sure it was the real reason for their visit.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/EndLog/Good	After the war Emilia became a public prosecutor in Pogoren. She used her law expertise in trials of war criminals who were brought to justice. She has never found out who the murderers of her family were, but deep inside she hopes they got what they deserved.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/EndLog/Mixed	After the war Emilia wanted to forget, so she left Pogoren and went to the USA where she joined a law firm. She makes good money - her father would be proud. However, she's troubled by waking nightmares and has developed hatred towards men.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/EndLog/Bad	Emilia survived the war, but it has left its mark on her. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She had developed anxiety and hatred towards men. She opened her private legal advice office, but hasn't been doing particularly well.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Emilia was refused refuge in the shelter. She was very determined to survive, so she might still have made it.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/EndLog/DwellerDied	Emilia joined the long list of casualties of this destructive conflict. The fact that she was young and well-off didn’t matter. War makes everyone equal.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	One night, Emilia took off alone and unnoticed. Unlikely as it might sound, she surfaced years after the war as a corporate lawyer abroad.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/EndLog/Suicide	Broken by the horrors of war Emilia slit her wrists. As the blood flowed from her veins, she thought about her murdered sister and father. She would see them again, soon.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/Bio	Now that we're stuck together, I might as well tell you about me and my family. Father was a very practical man. He always reminded us of the importance of financial safety. That's why I became a lawyer like him, and my sister was to become a doctor. When the war broke out, we had a lot of savings on our family account. But the currency soon lost all value, the banks were closed and we had no foreign cash. In a matter of days we became poor.
CharacterBios/Prawnik/DwellerCandidate	Excuse me for this intrusion... I'm really embarrassed to ask this of you, but... would you let me stay with you for some time? I can't go home, I tried to stay in my law office, but that area has recently become very dangerous... I really have nowhere to go...
CharacterBios/Prawnik/DeathNote	Maybe she was a talented lawyer, but it did her no good. It doesn’t matter who you are, war makes everyone equal.
CharacterBios/Star/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	All this shelling, sniper fire, and lack of supplies makes you want to hide away, sit down and cry. But we cannot let them crush our spirit, we have to show them that they can't take away our dignity. It's difficult here, but you know how we did it on our street?
CharacterBios/Star/Story_Step_1/Trauma	All this shelling, sniper fire, and lack of supplies makes you want to hide away, sit down and cry. It's hopeless. When the buildings on my street were still standing, we were trying to preserve our dignity, but did we manage to?
CharacterBios/Star/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	It was tough, but women living in our street took great care to look beautiful. They were always clean and wore their best clothes. That was a sight, I tell you. Lining up for water, they looked as if they were waiting to visit a theatre. And my boy came up with another idea.
CharacterBios/Star/Story_Step_2/Trauma	Women from our street took great care to look beautiful. They were always clean, wearing their best clothes, despite the terrible conditions. We tried so hard, but it was all in vain. Only kids still had some hope left... you know what my boy did?
CharacterBios/Star/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	You just can't lock kids inside with nothing to do. Life will find its way. So my boy formed a football team. They trained in a dark basement. They were so committed and came up with an idea to organize a Pogoren cup. We invited three other teams, but there was a significant problem we had to overcome.
CharacterBios/Star/Story_Step_3/Trauma	You just can't lock kids inside with nothing to do, so my boy formed a football team. It was heartbreaking to watch them train in a dark basement. They came up with an idea to organize a Pogoren cup. Even though I was terrified, we invited three other teams. We had a very serious problem to overcome.
CharacterBios/Star/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	The sports hall survived the shelling, but to get there we needed to cross the bridge under Grazni sniper fire. The Peacekeepers refused to help us with their armored transports, so we waited for a foggy night and just made a wild run for it. We made it safe. There weren't many spectators, but it was still the most memorable football cup of my life... My boy was so happy. Next day, my wife managed to escape with him abroad. I'll see them again when this is over.
CharacterBios/Star/Story_Step_4/Trauma	The sports hall survived the shelling, but to get there we needed to cross the bridge under Grazni sniper fire. The Peacekeepers refused to help us with their armored transports, so one night we just made a wild run for it. We didn't make it. They were just kids! How can anyone shoot at kids? Next day, my wife took him abroad. She was furious. I don't think I'll ever see them again.
CharacterBios/Star/EndLog/Good	Pavle survived the war. After months of searching, despite numerous difficulties, he managed to find his wife and son, who had sought refuge in France. He went there to live with them. They never came back to Pogoren.
CharacterBios/Star/EndLog/Mixed	Pavle survived the war. He tried to find his wife and son, but despite his best efforts he could not trace them. He decided to stay in Pogoren hoping his son would find him there one day. Years have passed, and he is still waiting.
CharacterBios/Star/EndLog/Bad	Pavle survived the war. He tried to find his wife and son, but despite his best efforts he could not trace them. He decided to stay in Pogoren hoping his son would find him there one day. That day never came.
CharacterBios/Star/EndLog/DwellerDied	Sadly, Pavle died. Will his family come back to Pogoren to visit his grave one day, or would it be too painful, a reminder of what they had gone through? Do the dead even care?
CharacterBios/Star/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Pavle was not welcome in the shelter. He was forced to fend for himself.
CharacterBios/Star/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Pavle decided to leave the shelter one fateful night. The next morning he was shot in the back, running from the bandits.
CharacterBios/Star/EndLog/Suicide	The only thing that kept Pavle going was the hope of seeing his son again; having lost that hope, Pavle did not want to carry on and committed suicide.
CharacterBios/Star/Bio	Before this whole mess begun, I lived with my wife and son in the better part of the city. I haven't seen them in a long time, I hope they are ok. I'm not doing so well, as you can see. Who needs football players during war? Nobody cares about sports when every day can be their last. So I scavenge the ruins like everyone else, hoping for the best.
CharacterBios/Star/DwellerCandidate	A sniper almost got me.... I thought I was a goner. I ran as fast as I could and that saved me, but it was a close call. I used to play on Pogoren football team, but war put an end to this. My wife and son are abroad, I hope to see them after the war. I have to make it. A boy should have a father. Can I stay here with you until then?
CharacterBios/Star/DeathNote	It’s Pavle… At least his son survived. Should he be told that his father is dead? I’ll think about it later.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	It's terribly quiet here, don't you think?... Ah, no, of course not, what with all the shooting and bombing, I just mean... This is my job conditioning showing, I'm afraid. You see, I'm a teacher. An elementary school principal.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Story_Step_1/Trauma	We could all use some cheering up, don't you think? Let me tell you a story... oh, I'm sorry, this is just my job conditioning showing, I'm afraid. You see, I used to be a teacher. An elementary school principal, if a lousy one.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	With the start of the siege, the attendance fell, as many parents chose to keep their kids home. One young man advised me to cover the windows with mattresses from the gym. "That's silly, children need the light to read", I said, "and besides, it's not like anyone is going to target the school!"
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Story_Step_2/Trauma	When the shooting started, parents were wary of sending their children to school. "What nonsense", I said , "this is the safest place for them". I was so confident that I didn't even cover the windows. Big, beautiful windows letting the light inside for kids to learn in a healthy environment. I was so stupid.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	I decided to move the children to the southern classrooms facing the gym and ordered them to sit in the benches away from the windows, just in case. That saved them when a shell fell on the street and all the panes in the northern wall shattered into a hail of glass shards. We covered the windows after that.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Story_Step_3/Trauma	Parents were right. Just to appease their fears, I moved the classes to more sheltered rooms. And that saved the children when the army landed a shell right in front of the school - the window panes shattered, but the hail of glass shards fell on empty benches and seats. We covered the windows after that.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	One Friday, I got a phone call: "Oh shit, sorry, is this the teacher? It's you! Oh no. Oh no. They told us the school had been evacuated. That there's a rebel outpost there. Get the kids out, now!" I rang the fire alarm and we barely managed to get away. "Why are they trying to kill us?", I heard one girl ask. "They aren't, dearie. It's all a terrible mistake", I answered.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Story_Step_4/Trauma	But I was still incredulous that anyone might target the children deliberately. I was wrong again. We had to evacuate in terrible haste, when an anonymous caller told me that the school would be fired upon in minutes. I finally got disillusioned when the shells destroyed my school just as we were running away. "Why are they trying to kill us?", I heard one girl cry. I didn't have an answer. I still don't.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/EndLog/Good	The war didn't extinguish the flame that drove Cveta to give everything to her calling. And one day, she got a visit from a former pupil - the same who made a frantic call one Friday to make sure that his old school had really been evacuated.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/EndLog/Mixed	With the children returning to school, Cveta couldn't keep herself from getting back to the familiar routine that once again gave a purpose to her life. But she never got rid of the fear for her pupils and of the recurring nightmares.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/EndLog/Bad	Cveta saved her own life, but not the internal fire that gave it a purpose. Disillusioned and bitter, she never returned to teaching and withdrew from public life, scraping a living on her meager disability pension.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/EndLog/DwellerDied	What answers could have Cveta found for all the difficult questions her pupils would pose, had she lived to see the end of the war? Now the children will have to find them on their own.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/EndLog/DwellerRejected	We decided that maybe others could make good use of Cveta's abilities. After all, we had no kids to care for, which was probably for the best.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Cveta quietly left the shelter, leaving no word behind. She somehow managed to survive the war, but didn't return to teaching.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/EndLog/Suicide	Bitter, unable to face the harsh reality of war any longer, Cveta committed suicide. Her students will have to rely on someone else to help them recover from the trauma of war.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/Bio	Oh dear, that is embarrassing. I know I'm not much of an asset in this terrible situation. I have good administrative and logistical skills, which won't be of any use, given the circumstances. I'm told I'm a good caregiver - I really love kids. What else? I have a driver's license... sorry, that was my poor attempt at a joke.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/DwellerCandidate	Thank you for answering the door, people tend to be so mistrustful of others nowadays. I'm Cveta, I used to be a principal of an elementary school. You're probably wondering what the reason of my visit could be... Well, honestly, I'm afraid to be alone in this dreadful situation. Would you mind if I stayed with you? I can take care of any children that might be with you.
CharacterBios/Nauczycielka/DeathNote	I wonder if Cveta would be a good teacher, one that would help children cope with their memories of war. I’ll never find out now.
CharacterBios/Studentka/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	The army is trying to break the rebels' morale with this incessant bombardment, but it's the civilians like us that suffer the most. When you've been under fire for so long, you learn to predict where a mortar shell will fall by the sound it makes. I'd never have thought about it, but one fateful day changed everything.
CharacterBios/Studentka/Story_Step_1/Trauma	Did you hear that? Another mortar shell. Not very far from here. Many people got used to the sound but I cringe at every single one of them. I freeze and remember one summer day in the first year of the war. The day which changed everything in my life.
CharacterBios/Studentka/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	The heat was intense and people were lining up for water. I was there with my parents and Tadei. Suddenly, there was a flash and I lost consciousness. Later I learned that a mortar shell exploded among us, wounding me and my brother and killing my parents. I had to explain to my brother that they were gone. Can you imagine losing your parents at the age of six?
CharacterBios/Studentka/Story_Step_2/Trauma	The heat was intense and people were lining up for water. I was there with my parents and Tadei when a shell exploded among us. When I got up and looked around, there were screams... blood... dead bodies everywhere... severed limbs... My brother was bleeding, crying, asking me where mommy and daddy were. I looked around, then hugged him and started to scream.
CharacterBios/Studentka/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	Doctors did a great job patching us up. We spent a few weeks in the hospital recovering, both physically and mentally. We were lucky that we survived, and we had each other. Our neighbors were helping me look after Tadei, because initially I had trouble catching up with him! Then he got his lucky ticket.
CharacterBios/Studentka/Story_Step_3/Trauma	I don't recall how we got to the hospital. They took out lots of shrapnel from our bodies. I became apathetic in the aftermath. Our neighbors started looking after my brother, because I'd lost the will to live. I kept thinking that I had cheated fate on that day. I no longer hid when I heard a shell. And then Tadei was taken from me.
CharacterBios/Studentka/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	The massacre was all over the TV news. In the aftermath, we were approached by a charity which offered foster homes for children in Canada. I decided to let them take Tadei out of Pogoren. He is now safe. I'm temporarily stuck here, but one day I'll join him and we'll be together again. I have a very good reason to stay alive.
CharacterBios/Studentka/Story_Step_4/Trauma	The massacre was all over the TV news. The footage showed us, bleeding, crying over the bodies of our parents. A charity got my brother out of Pogoren to Canada, to a foster home. But they left me here. I decided to live in spite of everything. One day I'll go to Canada, too. I don't want to die here, all alone and forgotten.
CharacterBios/Studentka/EndLog/Good	Zlata survived the war and was reunited with her brother in Canada. It took her some time to adjust to the new reality, but she found a job, and even resumed her music studies - at the Royal Conservatory in Toronto.
CharacterBios/Studentka/EndLog/Mixed	Zlata survived the war, but reaching Canada proved more difficult than she'd anticipated. Despite the difficulties, she remains determined and still believes she will see Tadei again one day.
CharacterBios/Studentka/EndLog/Bad	The war changed Zlata. She survived, but lost her optimism and cheerfulness. She decided against joining her brother. "I would only remind him of past horrors", she explained. "No, it will be better if I stay in Pogoren. Someone needs to tend to our parents' grave."
CharacterBios/Studentka/EndLog/DwellerDied	Zlata did not survive even though she was so young and full of life. Would she resume her music studies had she survived? Maybe the world lost a famous musician or composer.
CharacterBios/Studentka/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Zlata was not allowed to stay in the shelter. Let's hope she had better luck elsewhere.
CharacterBios/Studentka/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Zlata left the shelter one night. She fell victim to human traffickers while trying to reach her brother in Canada.
CharacterBios/Studentka/EndLog/Suicide	Zlata was a sensitive and compassionate girl, who tried to give hope to others. In the end, she herself lost all hope and took her own life. The world got bleaker the day she was found dead.
CharacterBios/Studentka/Bio	I was just accepted to the music academy when the war broke out. I had so many plans, I had dreams. I used to play the guitar, date boys, dance. My little brother Tadei always made me smile. It all seems a dream now, replaced by this nightmare we live in. Yet, I still hope one day we can forget the war and carry on with our lives as if it had never happened.
CharacterBios/Studentka/DwellerCandidate	Hi, you look friendly. My name's Zlata. I used to study at the Music Academy before it got closed due to war. What about we stick together for the time being? We can watch over each other! Besides, it's always better to have some company to cheer you up!
CharacterBios/Studentka/DeathNote	I’ll miss Zlata’s smile. Not many people smile these days. It’s really painful to see such a young life wasted.
CharacterBios/Katia/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I've been around more than any of my friends and relatives. I've met famous people, readers found my interviews funny and incisive. But when I try to write down my experiences... I'm stuck. I want to find and hug my folks, not write about them. I wish I had been seeing them more often.
CharacterBios/Katia/Story_Step_1/Trauma	I've been around more than any of my friends and relatives, been to the Oscar galas, talked to socialites. I should've stayed with my own people and talked to my folks. Instead, I wasted my life writing fluff pieces on buffoons - and deemed it important! You don't appreciate what you have until you lose it.
CharacterBios/Katia/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	This city used to welcome everybody with open arms. I loved the old town cafes where I could meet new friends from all over the world. Will people ever become this easygoing again? If we make it through, I must do what I can to help them remember how it was. Because we can accomplish a lot if we just stand together.
CharacterBios/Katia/Story_Step_2/Trauma	So many years I've spent away that I hardly recognized my city. I used to be friends with everybody. Now, if I smile to a stranger I'm taken for a fool or a prostitute or, worse still, a snitch. But I'm fine with that, there are other ways to compel people into seeing things my way.
CharacterBios/Katia/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	When, defeated, I was about to leave my parents' neighborhood, my childhood friend recognized me. I thought he'd help me find out what happened to my folks. Turned out it was I who could help. A local girl had been held up by the army under some pretense. Everybody turned up at the base to protest and demand her release. They needed a deputy.
CharacterBios/Katia/Story_Step_3/Trauma	I was about to leave my parents' neighborhood empty-handed when an acquaintance halted me and said that there was a "situation" I could help with. The army had arrested a local beauty under some cooked up charges. I guess it doesn't need explaining what she was wanted for. The locals pooled the ransom money and needed someone to deliver it.
CharacterBios/Katia/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	I marched into the base flashing my press badge and demanded - in English! - to see the commander. After a bit of bickering, he assured me that there must have been some mix-up and that the girl would be released. I guess the envelope with "evidence" gathered among the locals helped as much as my bluff... but what counts is that we got her out.
CharacterBios/Katia/Story_Step_4/Trauma	My press badge and a bit of bluffing bought me five minutes with the commander. It was all I needed to convince him that it would be in his best interests to give up the girl and take the bribe. He insisted that we exchange contacts to meet "in more opportune circumstances". I agreed... I still could use the opportunity to erase that smug smile off his face forever.
CharacterBios/Katia/EndLog/Good	Katia used her contacts to find her parents in a refugee camp abroad. She brought them back to the city and helped rebuild their house. Soon after that she published her war diary, which became a bestseller and drew widespread attention to the fate of civilians during war.
CharacterBios/Katia/EndLog/Mixed	Katia used her contacts to find her parents in a refugee camp abroad. She returned to her city, but they refused and once again they were separated. After a few years they passed away and only then did Katia find the determination to publish her war diary.
CharacterBios/Katia/EndLog/Bad	After the war Katia located her parents in a refugee camp abroad, but they were no longer the people she knew. They remained abroad, where they're struggling to forget the past. Katia has burnt all her notes and she never writes about the war.
CharacterBios/Katia/EndLog/DwellerDied	Katia never found her parents, but they did find her grave one day with her war diary buried alongside. They published it without any alterations. It became a bestseller.
CharacterBios/Katia/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Katia's smooth talking didn't secure her a place in the shelter. Unfortunately, she was later captured by the military and spent the rest of the war imprisoned. She never spoke of what happened to her in captivity.
CharacterBios/Katia/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Katia left the shelter one night, leaving behind her war diary. It was passed to her distraught parents, who published it after a few years.
CharacterBios/Katia/EndLog/Suicide	Unable to cope with what had transpired, Katia broke down completely. She was found dead, her hand still clutching her war diary. Her parents never learnt about her fate.
CharacterBios/Katia/Bio	I grew up in this city, but went abroad to study and started working as a reporter. I'd been away for years. When the troubles escalated into a war, I was picked to write reports on it. I'd have volunteered anyway, I was so anxious to check on my parents. But it was too late. I found my house in ruins, my family had disappeared. I've been looking for them ever since.
CharacterBios/Katia/DwellerCandidate	Hi, I'm Katia. Before this hell broke out I used to work as a reporter. I was the first to deliver breaking news, meet important people, and I travelled a lot. Now I don't even know where my family is. I hope they went into hiding and are ok. I'll stay here with you until the fighting is over, ok?
CharacterBios/Katia/DeathNote	Katia will not find her parents after all. She still had her diary, her parents should get it when this is over.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Psychologist/EndLog/Good	After the war ^CharacterName^ had confidence that the decision to stay was the right one. {ms|His}{fs|Her} expertise was invaluable in helping numerous victims of this horrible conflict. {ms|He}{fs|She} also decided that it was time to change one important aspect of {ms|his}{fs|her} life. Watching the families struggling to survive in ravaged Pogoren, {ms|he}{fs|she} realized the importance of having loved ones to give purpose to life. {ms|He}{fs|She} would start a family.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Psychologist/EndLog/Mixed	^CharacterName^ survived the war. {ms|He}{fs|She} was not sure if the decision to stay was the right one. {ms|He}{fs|She} wanted to help others, but in many cases people did not want {ms|his}{fs|her} help. Some things {ms|he}{fs|she} would rather forget. Even now, long after the war {ms|he}{fs|she} struggles to find some purpose to {ms|his}{fs|her} existence.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Psychologist/EndLog/Bad	^CharacterName^ managed to survive the war. Despite being a psychologist, {ms|he}{fs|she} could not cope with the horrors {ms|he}{fs|she} had witnessed and experienced during the siege of Pogoren. Several months after the war {ms|he}{fs|she} thrown {ms|himself}{fs|herself} under a train.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Psychologist/EndLog/DwellerDied	Like many other civilians in besieged Pogoren, ^CharacterName^ didn’t make it. {ms|His}{fs|Her} decision to stay and help others cost {ms|him}{fs|her} {ms|his}{fs|her} life. Was {ms|his}{fs|her} sacrifice in vain?
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Psychologist/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	One night ^CharacterName^ left the shelter without saying anything to anyone. When morning came, {ms|he}{fs|she} had already been gone. Whatever {ms|his}{fs|her} reasons were, they would remain unknown.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Psychologist/EndLog/Suicide	{ms|He}{fs|She} whose job was to help people cope with their problems and find the strength to live on, could not cope with {ms|his}{fs|her} own and committed suicide. What’s wrong with this world?
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Psychologist/Bio	As a psychologist, my work is to solve other people’s problems. I’d met with so many different cases I thought I’ve seen it all. How wrong I was. I’m so grateful I’ve got no family in Pogoren, I don’t know what I’d do if I had. I thought about leaving, but decided against it. “Hell, this is my city, these are my people” – I thought. Now… I’m not so sure it was the right decision. But since I can’t change it, let’s try to make the best out of our situation, regardless of how dire it is.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Psychologist/DeathNote	^CharacterName^ was a kind person, who always listened to everyone and had some advice for them. Pity.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Photographer/EndLog/Good	After the war ^CharacterName^ managed to find the model for whom {ms|he}{fs|she} came to Pogoren. They realized they had more in common than they had initially thought. Together they left Graznavia to seek a better future.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Photographer/EndLog/Mixed	When the war ended ^CharacterName^ went back home. {ms|He}{fs|She} hasn’t heard any news about the fate of the fascinating, young model {ms|he}{fs|she} had met in Pogoren, even though {ms|he}{fs|she} tried to contact her. Was she alive? Did she manage to avoid the atrocities? Would she even remember {ms|him}{fs|her}? ^CharacterName^ still has no answers.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Photographer/EndLog/Bad	When the end of war made travel once more possible ^CharacterName^ went back home. {ms|He}{fs|She} tried to find something about the young model {ms|he}{fs|she} had met in Pogoren but failed. Most likely she did not survive. A handful of pictures and memories was all that was left of her.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Photographer/EndLog/DwellerDied	War took ^CharacterName^’s life. {ms|He}{fs|She} was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It’s terrifying how blind chance can determine whether we live or die.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Photographer/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	One night ^CharacterName^ slipped away from the shelter. All trace of {ms|him}{fs|her} was lost.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Photographer/EndLog/Suicide	Despite support from others, ^CharacterName^ gave up on hope and committed suicide. Who would’ve known it would end like this, when {ms|he}{fs|she} arrived in Pogoren?
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Photographer/Bio	I came to Pogoren on business. I met a young, lovely model. I agreed for a photo session with her, as I thought she was exceptional and expected she would make a great career. We met a couple of times, before and after the photo shoot. Unfortunately war put an end to all of that. I don’t know what happened to that girl, but I got stuck here with no way to get back home. I’m afraid I might not make it out of here alive.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Photographer/DeathNote	Poor ^CharacterName^, did you have to die?
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Insurance_agent/EndLog/Good	^CharacterName^ survived the war and managed to find {ms|his}{fs|her} {ms|girlfriend}{fs|boyfriend}. It turned out {ms|Kate}{fs|John} had sent many letters, but they failed to reach ^CharacterName^ in Pogoren due to the siege. It took them some time to adjust to being together again, but they finally resumed their wedding plans.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Insurance_agent/EndLog/Mixed	As soon as it became possible ^CharacterName^ went to the UK to visit {ms|his}{fs|her} beloved. They tried being together again, but it did not work out. ^CharacterName^’s war experiences and long separation changed them too much, so they decided to go their separate ways. Eventually, each found someone to live the rest of their life with. They remain pen friends, if nothing more.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Insurance_agent/EndLog/Bad	To {ms|his}{fs|her} disappointment ^CharacterName^’s fears came true. Years of separation put their feelings to the test, and {ms|Kate}{fs|John} eventually gave up on {ms|him}{fs|her}. The hope of seeing {ms|Kate}{fs|John} again was what kept ^CharacterName^ alive through the war. Now {ms|his}{fs|her} life became empty and pointless. {ms|His}{fs|Her} depression discouraged others from attaching themselves to {ms|him}{fs|her}, and {ms|he}{fs|she} remained lonely for the rest of {ms|his}{fs|her} life.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Insurance_agent/EndLog/DwellerDied	It wasn’t until a year after the war that {ms|Kate}{fs|John} learned of ^CharacterName^’s tragic death, but at that time {ms|she}{fs|he} had already been married to someone else anyway.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Insurance_agent/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	One night ^CharacterName^ left the shelter to attempt to escape from Pogoren. {ms|He}{fs|She} was shot dead by a military sentry.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Insurance_agent/EndLog/Suicide	Overcome by despair, having lost all hope to see {ms|Kate}{fs|John} ever again, ^CharacterName^ chose to end {ms|his}{fs|her} life.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Insurance_agent/Bio	This fucking siege couldn’t have come at a worse moment. I have a {ms|girlfriend, Kate}{fs|boyfriend, John}. We first met during a student exchange in the UK. {ms|She}{fs|He} came to Pogoren for holiday and then moved here to stay. We’d just finished paying off our flat, and were about to get married, when we got the news of the siege. {ms|She}{fs|He} managed to board one of the last planes that left before the airport got closed. I didn’t. It’s been about three years since I last saw {ms|her}{fs|him} No letter came. I’m worried...
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Insurance_agent/DeathNote	You didn’t make it after all, ^CharacterName^. If I survive, I will tell your story to your beloved.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Chemist/EndLog/Good	^CharacterName^ and {ms|his}{fs|her} parents survived the war. They retired to the country, while {ms|he}{fs|she} resumed work at the pharmacy, and is doing really fine. As Pogoren slowly healed from the destruction, so did most of its inhabitants.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Chemist/EndLog/Mixed	Although ^CharacterName^ and {ms|his}{fs|her} family managed to survive the war, not all was well. Living in the basement made ^CharacterName^’s parents contract a serious lung disease. Most of their retirement money went to buying necessary medicines, and ^CharacterName^ had to take the burden of supporting them.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Chemist/EndLog/Bad	When ^CharacterName^ got back to {ms|his}{fs|her} parents, it turned out they were both dying of disease. Several months after the war, ^CharacterName^ buried them at Pogoren cemetery. With a heavy heart {ms|he}{fs|she} resumed work at the pharmacy, but all the joy of success was gone, replaced with deep, lingering sadness.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Chemist/EndLog/DwellerDied	^CharacterName^ died before the war ended. {ms|His}{fs|Her} parents joined {ms|him}{fs|her} shortly after, killed by a lung disease they had contracted while living in the basement.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Chemist/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	^CharacterName^ left the shelter for reasons known only to {ms|him}{fs|her}. Who knows what happened to {ms|him}{fs|her}.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Chemist/EndLog/Suicide	^CharacterName^ committed suicide. {ms|His}{fs|Her} old parents died from disease soon after, not knowing their child’s fate.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Chemist/Bio	Before all this mess, it had been a really good year for me. I was appreciated at work and finally got promoted. Even though everyone around was worried about the threat of war, I found the notion that it might reach us here very improbable. One day, shortly after I came home to tell my parents about my promotion, we heard alarm sirens. We managed to hide in our basement just before the first explosions shook the ground and everything got covered by dust.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Chemist/DeathNote	Farewell ^CharacterName^, you’ll be missed.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Forester/EndLog/Good	As soon as the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ left Pogoren to seek better life elsewhere. Thanks to a foreign charity that organized an aid program for Graznavia war refugees {ms|he}{fs|she} ended up in the woodlands of Canada, happy to remain close to nature and far from people’s affairs.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Forester/EndLog/Mixed	Even though the fighting ended, ^CharacterName^ had trouble finding {ms|his}{fs|her} place in the world. For some time {ms|he}{fs|she} had been receiving help from various charities, but when that ran out, {ms|he}{fs|she} remained in Pogoren; a homeless and unemployed scavenger.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Forester/EndLog/Bad	When the war ended, ^CharacterName^ had problems adapting. Like many people in similar circumstances {ms|he}{fs|she} found solace in drinking. Homeless, unemployed, rejected by society, {ms|he}{fs|she} went on a downward spiral, until one winter day {ms|his}{fs|her} body was found frozen in the street.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Forester/EndLog/DwellerDied	^CharacterName^ joined the long list of civilian casualties of war. With no family to miss {ms|him}{fs|her}, {ms|he}{fs|she} would soon be forgotten.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Forester/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Looking for more luck elsewhere, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter and {ms|his}{fs|her} further wherebouts remain unknown.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Forester/EndLog/Suicide	Having lost all hope ^CharacterName^ commited suicide. With no family to miss {ms|him}{fs|her}, {ms|he}{fs|she} would soon be forgotten.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Forester/Bio	When the war broke out, I’d been unemployed for over a year. With dread I watched the news of the upcoming conflict. I was hoping against hope it would not come. Living of unemployment benefits had already been hard, and with the soaring prices I wouldn’t have made it, if not for the people running the shelter for the homeless. They were very kind and welcoming, and I could always count on a bowl of hot soup. But that’s the past. A shell hit their shelter.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Forester/DeathNote	^CharacterName^’s body… Poor soul; I wonder if {ms|he}{fs|she} has some supplies on {ms|him}{fs|her}…
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Computer_specialist/EndLog/Good	When the siege was lifted, ^CharacterName^ quickly returned home. Though shaken, underfed and exhausted {ms|he}{fs|she} knew that this affair could’ve ended up much worse than that. {ms|He}{fs|She} would never come back to Pogoren again.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Computer_specialist/EndLog/Mixed	When the siege was lifted, ^CharacterName^ quickly took the opportunity to return home. The memories of what had transpired in Pogoren would change {ms|him}{fs|her} forever.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Computer_specialist/EndLog/Bad	^CharacterName^ returned home as soon as the siege of Pogoren was lifted. The horrors {ms|he}{fs|she} witnessed and was part of would scar {ms|him}{fs|her} forever. {ms|He}{fs|She} would never feel safe again, and would always keep an ample stash of food and most important supplies, just in case.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Computer_specialist/EndLog/DwellerDied	^CharacterName^ shared the fate of many other unfortunate souls who were caught in the siege of Pogoren.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Computer_specialist/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	^CharacterName^ left the shelter, deciding {ms|he}{fs|she} would fare better on {ms|his}{fs|her} own.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Computer_specialist/EndLog/Suicide	^CharacterName^ was pushed to {ms|his}{fs|her} limits, broke under pressure and commited suicide.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Computer_specialist/Bio	I was on holiday when the siege began. I had met an interesting {ms|woman}{fs|man} on the Internet and after several months of chatting I decided to accept {ms|her}{fs|his} invitation to visit {ms|her}{fs|him}. {ms|She}{fs|He} showed me around Pogoren. I was anxious why so many people were leaving. There was an ominous aura over the city. However, I was assured that there was nothing to worry about. Nobody here wanted war and they would never allow it to break out. But it did. I tried to flee the city but it was already too late.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Computer_specialist/DeathNote	Maybe you weren’t the best friend I’ve ever had, ^CharacterName^, but we were in this mess together. And now you’re dead.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Nurse/EndLog/Good	When the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ went home, heart pounding with fear of what {ms|He}{fs|She} might await {ms|him}{fs|her} there. Miraculously, the house was still standing and {ms|his}{fs|her} mother was alright.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Nurse/EndLog/Mixed	When the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ went home, with dark thoughts going through {ms|his}{fs|her} head. The area was heavily ravaged by artillery fire, and {ms|his}{fs|her} house was destroyed. {ms|His}{fs|Her} mother was alive though, saved by neighbors.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Nurse/EndLog/Bad	When the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ went home, only to find it in ruins. {ms|His}{fs|Her} mother was nowhere around. The neighbors said there was still hope, that she could’ve moved to one of the refugee camps. But ^CharacterName^ knew better.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Nurse/EndLog/DwellerDied	^CharacterName^ died during the siege of Pogoren. The fate of {ms|his}{fs|her} mother remains unknown.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Nurse/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	^CharacterName^ left the shelter at night, in search of {ms|his}{fs|her} mother. Did {ms|he}{fs|she} manage to get through the front line to the cut-off area? Hopefully, yes.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Nurse/EndLog/Suicide	Rather than continue suffering, ^CharacterName^ decided to take {ms|his}{fs|her} own life. Her mother was heartbroken.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Nurse/Bio	The hospital where I worked was not evacuated. No one knew what was about to happen, until it was too late. The news of the siege were so sudden, and the patients so numerous that nothing could have been done in time. We had a huge influx of wounded. After the horrors of the first day I decided to leave the hospital to stay with my mother, but that part of town had already been cut off. I hope my mother is alright.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Nurse/DeathNote	Damn it, ^CharacterName^, how did you get yourself killed…
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Police_officer/EndLog/Good	^CharacterName^ survived the war, and found {ms|his}{fs|her} beloved in one of the temporary refugee camps. They managed to put their war experiences behind them, and remain a couple until this day.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Police_officer/EndLog/Mixed	^CharacterName^ survived, and after a long search managed to find {ms|his}{fs|her} beloved, who was scarred by he fire and became gloomy and withdrawn. {ms|He}{fs|She} stayed with {ms|her}{fs|him} although things were never the same again.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Police_officer/EndLog/Bad	The things ^CharacterName^ witnessed and did during the war, made {mr|him}{fr|her} lose conviction. {mr|He}{fr|She} did not return to work as a police officer, nor did {mr|he}{fr|she} think {mr|himself}{fr|herself} worthy of {mr|his}{fr|her} beloved. They never saw each other again.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Police_officer/EndLog/DwellerDied	Sadly ^CharacterName^ did not live to see the end of the fighting. Collateral damage, as the military would put it.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Police_officer/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	One night ^CharacterName^ left the shelter and did not come back. {ms|His}{fs|Her} motivation remains unknown.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Police_officer/EndLog/Suicide	^CharacterName^ could not take it anymore and chose to take {ms|his}{fs|her} life, rather than continue like this.
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Police_officer/Bio	Just before war reached Pogoren, our unit had received news of planned evacuation of most of the uniformed services from the city. I stayed, because I failed to convince my beloved to leave, and I couldn’t leave {ms|her}{fs|him} here alone. We didn’t know how dire the situation would become. One day, when I was coming home from a walk with my dog, I heard the first alarm sirens. I ran as fast as I could, but it was already too late. My flat was in flames. I couldn’t find my beloved… or {ms|her}{fs|his} body…
CharacterBios/ScenarioEditorCharacters/Police_officer/DeathNote	As a police officer, you probably always took risks, but I bet you never expected to die like this.

NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/VISITORS/NeedProtection/2Y/NPCSpeeches/Visitor/visitFailure/00	I see... maybe they won't hurt us... but we must prepare for the worst...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/VISITORS/NeedProtection/3Y/NPCSpeeches/Visitor/visitorInside/00	Hi again! I came to thank you for your help.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/VISITORS/NeedProtection/3Y/NPCSpeeches/Visitor/visitSuccess/00	I hope you don't need to use it, but you never know.

NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/TraderSon/DeadDad/00	Dad... I miss you...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/TraderSon/DeadDad/01	What am I gonna tell mom?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/TraderSon/DeadDad/02	I thought I could protect you... It's all my fault...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/TraderSon/DeadDad/03	Dad... If only I could find those bastards...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/TraderSon/TradeRequest	Hey, you! I need meds for my father, got some?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/TraderSon/TradeSuccess	Thank you! This helps us a lot!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/TraderSon/TradeFailure	Please, bring some bandages or medication...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/Father/NPCSpeeches/HelpCall/00	Someone's here!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/Father/NPCSpeeches/HelpCall/01	Son! Help me!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/Father/NPCSpeeches/HelpCallNextTime/00	Someone's here again!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/Father/NPCSpeeches/HelpCallNextTime/01	Son! Son! It's this intruder again!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/Father/NPCSpeeches/BodyDiscoveredKillerUnknown/Friend/00	Son, no...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/Father/NPCSpeeches/BodyDiscoveredKillerUnknown/Friend/01	Son... my son... don't leave me...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/Father/NPCSpeeches/BodyDiscoveredKillerUnknown/Friend/02	Please... What am I going to do without you?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/002/Father/NPCSpeeches/BodyDiscoveredKillerUnknown/Friend/03	No... I should've been the first to go... Why...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/Requests/BeggarRequest1	{mr|Sir}{fr|Madam}, I'm so hungry...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/Requests/BeggarRequest2	Please {mr|sir}{fr|madam}, could you spare something to eat?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/Requests/BeggarRequest3	I haven't eaten for days... Could you help me?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/Requests/BeggarRequest4	I'm too weak to search for food. I'd be grateful for any help.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/RequestsAfterFailed/BeggarRequest1	Perhaps you could bring some food next time...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/RequestsAfterFailed/BeggarRequest2	It's humiliating, but I'm forced to beg you for help...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/RequestsAfterFailed/BeggarRequest3	I'll die in a few days without food...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/RequestsAfterFailed/BeggarRequest4	You didn't seem to be such a heartless {mr|man}{fr|woman}...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/TextAboutHouse/01	There were more of us living here before the food ran out...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/TextAboutHouse/02	I moved after I'd lost my house in a shelling...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/TextAboutHouse/03	One of us was torn apart by a shell. He was standing too close to the wall.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/TextAboutHouse/04	Does it matter if someone became homeless before or during the war?

NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/thanksAgain/01	I'm so grateful...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/thanksAgain/02	Thank you once again...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/thanks	I don't know how to thank you enough...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/firstMeet	I'm very hungry. Could you help me...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/firstSpotted	Good evening, {mr|sir}{fr|madam}!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/secondSpotted	Oh... Hello again, {mr|sir}{fr|madam}.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/BeggarLostTarget	Did {mr|he}{fr|she} leave...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/bored	I won't bother you anymore...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/tradeResultIsFailer	Well... Maybe next time.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/revealTresure	I have something you may find interesting...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/IShowYouTreasure	I will show you, come with me.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/TreasureHere	Have a look, there's something peculiar behind the barrels.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Beggar/soSick	I don't feel well...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Scavenger/Suprised	Hey, you scared me!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/004/Scavenger/FoundHim	I found him like this.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Bandits/Intro_01/Warrior1_1	No one fucks with us! We own this city!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Bandits/Intro_01/Warrior1_2	I'm a little drunk!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Bandits/Intro_01/Warrior1_3	I need some sleep...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Bandits/Intro_02/Warrior1_1	The building across the street looks quite wealthy.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Bandits/Intro_02/Warrior1_2	We should raid it tomorrow night.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Family/Intro_01/Son1_1	...I have to take care of my parents......
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Family/Intro_01/Son1_2	...because if not me, then who?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Family/Intro_02/Son1_1	MOM! Everything alright?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/003_Family/Intro_02/Son1_2	Oh, she doesn't hear me, she's a little deaf...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/005/TraderBandit/TradeRequest	Hi, you need something?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/005/TraderBandit/TradeSuccess	Thanks!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/005/TraderBandit/TradeFailure	Maybe next time.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/005/Client/WasOkey	Oh yeah, she knows how to handle a man.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/005/Lady/00	Oh my God, is it really finally over?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/005/Lady/01	I can't believe it, are we really saved?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/005/Lady/02	Can it be true? Is it the end of this nightmare?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/start/00	How many supplies are left...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/start/01	Do we have enough supplies?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/start/02	I should check what they brought...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/A/00	What have we got here...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/A/01	Let's see...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/B/00	Some bandages, ammo...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/B/01	Weapons...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/C/00	...some useless shit...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/C/01	... and... what's this thing...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/C/02	...cans from humanitarian aid... they make me puke...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/end/01	That's a nice stock.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/end/02	Enough for a few days.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/007/Storekeeper/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/end/03	Could be better.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/TraderFather/TradeRequest	We need weapons, you got some?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/TraderFather/TradeSuccess	If you want anything else, be quick about it, we might be leaving soon.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/TraderFather/TradeFailure	You haven't got anything? Damn...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/Father/WantToTrade	If you want to trade, meet me in the courtyard.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/Father/StopThere	Stop right there, I'll come down to you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/Father/WeWontTradeHere	Leave the building! We'll trade outside.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/ShotgunGirl/01	Show yourself!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/ShotgunGirl/02	Don't hide!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/010/ShotgunGirl/03	You're dead!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/011/TraderSoldier/TradeRequest	Watch it, this is a restricted area. Better have some good stuff to trade.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/011/TraderSoldier/TradeSuccess	You did your civic duty, heh heh...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/011/TraderSoldier/TradeFailure	Next time bring more booze, citizen.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/011/Soldier/Hey_Amir	Come with me!

NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Move/01	Better move.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Move/02	Move!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Move/03	Enough, they can't find us.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Hit/01	Dead.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Hit/02	Bullseye.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Hit/03	Hit.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Missed/01	Wounded.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Missed/02	I missed.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Missed/03	Target still alive.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Loud/01	Whoa!

NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/AfterYou/02	Coming.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/AfterYou/03	After You.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Target/01	Guy near the water collector.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Target/02	The kid leaning through the window.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Target/03	Rebel militiaman at checkpoint.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Target/04	Woman gathering wood.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Target/05	Man sneaking through those ruins.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/SniperSquad/Target/06	Woman with shopping bags.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/013/RadioAmbush/RadioMan_01	Soldiers! Run!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/012/Carrier/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/01	Hey, stranger! Wanna trade? Go to the first floor.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/012/Hostage/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/01	Please, don't hurt me! They captured me! I'm a hostage.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/012/Carrier2/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/01	Get away from here! If you want to trade, go downstairs.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldLady/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	Where is my husband...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldLady/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	What is going on...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldLady/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/04	Please, call my husband.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldLady/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/05	I don't understand, where did my husband go?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldLady/SeesOldManStandingUp/01	Is something wrong, my dear?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldLady/SeesOldManStandingUp/02	What happened?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/UnspecificTime/00	What is happening...? Who are you?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/UnspecificTime/01	Oh... How did you enter...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/Last/01	What are you looking for?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/Last/02	My wife's sick and not in the mood for visitors.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/Last/03	I heard it's dangerous... We try not to go out.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/Last/05	I'm afraid we can't do anything for you...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/LastNervous/03	Are you looking for valuables? I'm afraid we sold everything.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/LastNervous/02	Please, at least don't hurt my wife, she's not well...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/LastNervous/05	Are you gonna kill us...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/LastNervous/06	You are with the bandits? I heard they rob people blind...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/DwellerScavengingPrivate/00	What are you doing? Please, leave something for us...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/DwellerScavengingPrivate/01	Why are you taking this? It's ours!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/DwellerScavengingPrivate/02	I beg you, don't take the food, we have so little.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/DwellerScavengingPrivate/03	Please, don't take my wife's medicine...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/DwellerScavengingPrivate/04	Do you have to do that? Where's your conscience!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/WarningNextTime/00	It's you again? What do you want from us?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/WarningNextTime/01	I was hoping you wouldn't come back...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/IntruderLeft/00	What a strange visitor...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/IntruderLeft/01	I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} won't come back...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/DwellerStolePrivate/00	Please don’t take our things!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/DwellerStolePrivate/01	How can you do this?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/014/OldMan/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/DwellerStolePrivate/02	Have mercy! Don’t take that!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Violator/Prompt_UNUSED/00	Move, bitch. Wanna piss off the army?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Violator/Prompt_UNUSED/02	Shut up! You should be proud to serve a soldier.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Violator/Prompt_UNUSED/03	Walk, you piece of shit, don't make me smack you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Violator/LastPrompt/00	Sure you will... Now get in there and shut up!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Girl/Stops/00	Please, let me go...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Girl/Stops/02	Just let me go... I won't tell anyone...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Girl/Stops/03	No! Please! I can't do this!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Girl/LastStop/00	I beg you... I'll do anything...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Girl/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTime/00	Please, help me!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_bad_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/00	You heard about what that soldier did? Unthinkable...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_bad_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/02	She used to live next door... helped me with the groceries sometimes.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_bad_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/03	No one helped... It was one drunk soldier... Someone could have stopped him.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_bad_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/04	It's the worst thing this war does to us... People just don't care anymore.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_good_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/00	You heard about that soldier, what he tried to do? Good thing the girl is safe now...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_good_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/01	She lives next door, helps me with the groceries sometimes.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_good_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/02	I don't want to think what would've happened if this soldier hadn't been stopped.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_good_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/03	She's exhausted and shocked, but her family is taking care of her.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_good_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/04	The military can't do what they want with impunity!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Commenter/Commenter_good_ending/NPCSpeeches/Story/05	People still have the strength to fight back!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Scavengers/Leader_01	Luba, you take the downstairs.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Scavengers/Leader_02	Igor, you take the upstairs and the roof.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/015/Scavengers/Scevengers	Got it!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/StorySequence/A	Help! Please, help me!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/StorySequence/B	A sniper shot me... you're lucky he didn't kill you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/StorySequence/C	I was going home with medicine for my boy when I was hit...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/StorySequence/D	I wanted to use the sewers, but someone blocked the entrance...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/StorySequence/E	Please, can you do something about it?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/WaitForHelp/00	Please, I need to get to my boy, he's just a baby...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/WaitForHelp/01	That bastard is still shooting... Why won't he leave us alone?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/WaitForHelp/02	Could you please do something about the sewer door?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/WaitForHelp/03	If I try to run for it, I'm dead...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/FirstThanks/00	You don't know how grateful I am... Come with me, I'll try to repay you somehow.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/DoorOpened/00	Did I just hear {mr|him}{fr|her} open that door...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/FollowPrompt/00	I think I will have something for you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/FollowPrompt/01	Follow me, I have a flat nearby.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/FollowPrompt/02	We're almost there. I just hope my boy is fine...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/SufferBreak/00	He needs me... I've gotta hold on...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/SufferBreak/01	Damn, it hurts so much... But there's no time for self-pity.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/SufferBreak/02	Just a few more steps and everything will be fine...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/GoalReached/A	Jakob, daddy's here... And he's not going anywhere...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/Reward/A	There's a box beneath the bed, take as much as you need.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/Reward/B	I don't want to think what would have happened if it wasn't for you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/BabyCare/00	Good, the fever is dropping...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/BabyCare/01	I brought everything we need, Jakob. We're gonna make it.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/BabyCare/02	Your dad had some adventures, little guy.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/WoundedMan/BabyCare/03	I know you don't like the taste, but you have to eat it...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/Helper/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	I tell you, if I could get my hands on that sniper...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/Helper/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	I don't wanna think how many lives his bullets took...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/Helper/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	Better think twice before going there.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/Helper/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	As for me, I'm gonna stick to this building.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/Helper/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/04	I must admit this sniper is one dangerous warrior. Elusive like a ghost.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/Helper/NPCSpeeches/Story/A	Watch out, you don't wanna get shot by the sniper.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/Helper/NPCSpeeches/Story/B	The bastard is in the hotel, covers the whole damn street.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/016/Helper/NPCSpeeches/Story/C	You either take cover behind something or stay away.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	I know exactly when this war will end. I know.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	I'm not gonna tell, oh no. They're listening. Shhh!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	This war is a part of a greater plan... but don't tell anyone.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/04	I know what they want! But if I tell you, we're both dead!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/05	I know how to end this hell... but it's a secret.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/06	Fools! I told them this was folly, but they wouldn't listen!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/07	It began here, yet it will end with the whole world in ashes!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/08	I tell you, it's all a chess game for politicians. Let's not be their pawns!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/09	And when the darkness rises in the East, I shall take up my sword!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Loner2/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/01	Oh, hello! Don't be afraid, I'm just looking around.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Security/NPCSpeeches/ProtectedArea/Warning/UnspecificTime/01	This area is off limits. Leave now.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Priest/NPCSpeeches/Attacking/01	Help!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Priest/NPCSpeeches/Attacking/02	Oh, no!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Priest/NPCSpeeches/MeleeCombat/lose/04	Don't hurt me...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/017/Church_Priest/NPCSpeeches/MeleeCombat/lose/03	Please, no!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/00	Hello. Is everything alright?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/02	Please, behave! You're in a hospital!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/03	If you have medications to trade, you should talk to the doctor.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	We've lost so many patients...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	The last shelling was the worst. It's a miracle we can still work.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	Some of the personnel died, but some just left. I don't blame them.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	We're trying to admit everyone. Even if they wear a uniform.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/start/00	I should check the medication stock.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/start/01	I need some bandages.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/end/01	We're running low...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/end/02	Only a few left.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHello/00	My goodness, what happened to you? Let me help you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHello/01	You don't look well, {mr|sir}{fr|ma'am}. Can I help you?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHello/02	If you need my help, I'll do what I can.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHelp/00	Here, you should feel better soon.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHelp/01	I hope this helps.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHelp/02	I'm sorry I can't do more, but we have very limited resources.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHelpRefuse/00	I'm sorry but we have patients in more serious condition.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHelpRefuse/01	You don't seem to need my help.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse/TreatmentHelpRefuse/02	If you get worse, I'll be here to help you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/00	Hello... After the last shelling, we can't admit any more patients.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/01	Please, speak with the doctor! We desperately need medicines and bandages.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/02	Please, don't disturb the patients. They're still in shock!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	The shelling... I don't wanna remember...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	So many patients died in the shelling... So many...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	We're gonna save as many as we can.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	We can't give up... We're responsible for them...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/start/00	Are there any bandages left...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/start/01	Oh yes... the medication...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/end/00	Not enough... not enough...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/end/01	How are we gonna work with no supplies?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/00	Excuse me... We're in a dire situation...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/01	You're here to see the doctor? I'm afraid he's... he's dead.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/02	Be careful, there's been a murder recently...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	How can people be so cruel?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	It's so hard without the doctor...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	Doctor Jefimow was a hero.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/start/00	Are there any bandages left...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/start/01	I doubt there are any medications left...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/end/00	Now there's no one to restock the supplies.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Nurse_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/end/01	The doctor managed to get the medicine somehow.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Welcome/00	Evening. If you have any medicine or bandages, I'll buy them from you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Welcome/01	Evening. Are you here to donate medical supplies?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Success/00	The hospital is grateful for your contribution.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Success/01	The patients will appreciate this.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Fail/00	If you aren't interested in helping us, why are you bothering me?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Fail/01	If you don't want to help, at least don't disturb.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Prompt/00	Hurry up, I'm busy.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Prompt/01	Why are you hesitating?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Welcome/00	Are you here to donate supplies? If not, leave me alone.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Welcome/01	After the last shelling we need some damn charity... Excuse my French.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Success/00	Good... Have you got more?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Success/01	Yeah, thank you. Maybe we'll have fewer deaths tonight.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Fail/00	Why are you wasting my time? Can't you see what's going on here?!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Fail/01	What? Nothing? Why the hell are you even here?!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Prompt/00	Hurry up, people are dying here.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Prompt/01	Still making up your mind? Maybe you could do it elsewhere.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_goodtrade/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Welcome/00	Are you from the group that helped us lately?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_goodtrade/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Welcome/01	We had a generous offer lately. Will you top that?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_goodtrade/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Success/00	Good. Almost as good as the last time.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_goodtrade/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Success/01	The hospital is grateful, but I personally expected more.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_goodtrade/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Fail/00	I thought better of you. What a disappointment.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_goodtrade/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Fail/01	I guess I thought too highly of you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_goodtrade/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Prompt/00	We still need more supplies.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_goodtrade/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Prompt/01	The hospital had some help, but there's never enough.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_theft/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Welcome/00	We need supplies more than ever. Some bastard has robbed us lately.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_theft/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Welcome/01	Hello. Any donation is welcome after the last robbery.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_theft/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Success/00	Thank you. I'll make sure the guards don't allow anyone to take it.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_theft/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Success/01	We still have a shortage after the theft, but it's better than nothing.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_theft/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Fail/00	You interrupted my work for this? Who do you think you are?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_theft/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Fail/01	I can handle thieves, but I don't have the patience for idiots.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_theft/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Prompt/00	Listen, I have security issues on my head right now.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Doctor_theft/NPCSpeeches/LocationTrader/Prompt/01	Are you here to trade, or to prowl...?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	Are you a patient?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	It's like a field hospital built on the ruins of a real one...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	I'm lucky they admitted me.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	Nurses here are like angels!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/04	Someone should give those nurses a medal.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/05	I don't think doctor Jefimow gets his salary.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/06	No more shellings... Please...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	Prayer doesn't help...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	Doctor Jefimow seems shattered...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	I fear these are the last days of this hospital...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	Sometimes I regret I survived the shelling...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/04	We lost Julian. Doesn't matter that he was a soldier, he was one of us.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_afterbomb/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/05	A nurse died... She was like family to me.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	Have you heard? They killed our doctor.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	It was hard before, but now...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	Doctor Jefimow saved so many lives. Why would anyone want to take his?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	Some people are worse than beasts, I tell you.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Patient_deaddoctor/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/04	Good we still have the nurses.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Guard_intro/NPCSpeeches/Story/A	Hey you! Can you help?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Guard_intro/NPCSpeeches/Story/B	If you find any medical supplies in the rubble, return them to the doctor.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/018/Guard_intro/NPCSpeeches/Story/C	We lost much in the last shelling, we could use an extra pair of hands.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/001/CPN_Scavenger/intro1	Always so bullheaded... I told you this would happen!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/001/CPN_Scavenger/intro2	Oh... hello. Don't mind me, I was taking care of an old friend of mine.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/001/CPN_Scavenger/intro3	He didn't deserve to become crow food. Nobody does. Take care of youself.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/001/CPN_Scavenger/Intro4	Take care of yourself.
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTime/Warrior/01	{mr|Son of a bitch!}{fr|You cunt!}
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTime/Warrior/02	What?!
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTime/Warrior/03	Shit!
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTime/02	What...?!
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTime/03	Hey! What are you looking for?!
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTime/04	Who are you?!
NPCSpeeches/MeetNextTime/01	{mr|He}{fr|She}'s still here!
NPCSpeeches/MeetNextTime/03	{mr|He}{fr|She}'s here again!
NPCSpeeches/MeetNextTime/05	It's you again?!
NPCSpeeches/MeetRunningAway/00	What?!
NPCSpeeches/MeetRunningAway/01	Someone's here!
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/010/00	Who's there? Oh, I thought you might be one of those crazy girls...
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/010/01	Oh, look out for these crazy bitches in the second building.
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/Warrior/00	Hi. Don't make any trouble.
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/Warrior/01	Careful {mr|pal}{fr|girl}, I've got my eye on you.
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/Warrior/02	Hey {mr|man}{fr|lady}. Don't do anything stupid, okay?
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/00	Oh! I didn't know someone's here.
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/01	Hey! Don't sneak up on me like that, {mr|pal}{fr|girl}...
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/02	Oh... Hello...
NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/03	Someone's here? Good evening.
NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/Warrior/00	You don't wanna cause trouble here, trust me.
NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/Warrior/01	Don't mess with me...
NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/Warrior/02	I've got my eye on you.
NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	I don't want any trouble.
NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	Don't mind me.
NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	I don't mean any harm.
NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/04	I'm just looking for something...
NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/05	Let's not get in each other's way.
NPCSpeeches/Attacking/02	I'll kill you!
NPCSpeeches/Attacking/03	You're dead!
NPCSpeeches/Attacking/04	That was your last mistake!
NPCSpeeches/Attacking/05	Die, {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
NPCSpeeches/AttackingNoticed/Warrior/00	Get the {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
NPCSpeeches/AttackingNoticed/Warrior/01	Hit {mr|him}{fr|her}!
NPCSpeeches/AttackingNoticed/Warrior/02	Don't go easy on {mr|him}{fr|her}!
NPCSpeeches/AttackingNoticed/00	Make {mr|him}{fr|her} leave!
NPCSpeeches/AttackingNoticed/01	Get {mr|him}{fr|her}!
NPCSpeeches/AttackingNoticed/02	Do something!
NPCSpeeches/CowardAttackedNoticed/Warrior/00	Stop! Leave {mr|him}{fr|her} alone!
NPCSpeeches/CowardAttackedNoticed/Warrior/01	You'll regret touching {mr|him}{fr|her}!
NPCSpeeches/CowardAttackedNoticed/Warrior/02	You made a big mistake hurting {mr|him}{fr|her}!
NPCSpeeches/CowardAttackedNoticed/00	Please, don't hurt {mr|him}{fr|her}!
NPCSpeeches/CowardAttackedNoticed/01	No! Leave {mr|him}{fr|her} alone!
NPCSpeeches/CowardAttackedNoticed/02	Stop it! Why are you hurting {mr|him}{fr|her}?!
NPCSpeeches/ChasedTooFar/00	That's it, I'm going back...
NPCSpeeches/ChasedTooFar/01	I better go back.
NPCSpeeches/Search/Warrior/04	Come out, you {mr|bastard}{fr|cunt}!
NPCSpeeches/Search/Warrior/01	Where is this {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}...
NPCSpeeches/Search/Warrior/03	I'm gonna find you!
NPCSpeeches/Search/01	Where is {mr|he}{fr|she}?
NPCSpeeches/Search/02	Is {mr|he}{fr|she}'s hiding?
NPCSpeeches/Search/03	Is {mr|he}{fr|she} still here...?
NPCSpeeches/SearchOfKiller/00	Where's that fuckin' murderer...
NPCSpeeches/SearchOfKiller/01	^CharacterName^... I will find the fucker who did this to you.
NPCSpeeches/SearchOfKiller/02	You'll pay for what you did to ^CharacterName^!
NPCSpeeches/SearchOfKiller/03	Where are you, bastard? I'll get you!
NPCSpeeches/SearchOfKiller/04	Whoever you are, you'll pay for this!
NPCSpeeches/SearchOfKiller/05	You killed ^CharacterName^! You won't get away from me!
NPCSpeeches/SearchOfKiller/06	I'll get you for what you did to ^CharacterName^!
NPCSpeeches/SearchOfKiller/07	You can run but you can't hide!
NPCSpeeches/SearchFound/Warrior/00	Found that {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
NPCSpeeches/SearchFound/Warrior/01	The {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch} is here!
NPCSpeeches/SearchFound/Warrior/02	Found you!
NPCSpeeches/SearchFound/00	No, {mr|he}{fr|she}'s still here!
NPCSpeeches/SearchFound/01	I found {mr|him}{fr|her}!
NPCSpeeches/SearchFound/02	{mr|He}{fr|She}'s here!
NPCSpeeches/SearchNoticedByFriend/00	Someone's here, ^CharacterName^?
NPCSpeeches/SearchNoticedByFriend/01	What's going on, ^CharacterName^? Who are you looking for?
NPCSpeeches/SearchAssist/01	I'll help you find {mr|him}{fr|her}.
NPCSpeeches/SearchAssist/02	Let's look for {mr|him}{fr|her} together.
NPCSpeeches/SearchGiveUp/00	I think {mr|he}{fr|she} got away.
NPCSpeeches/SearchGiveUp/01	{mr|He}{fr|She} must've fled.
NPCSpeeches/RunningAway/Warrior/01	I'm out!
NPCSpeeches/RunningAway/Warrior/02	Screw this...
NPCSpeeches/RunningAway/Warrior/03	Fuck it...
NPCSpeeches/RunningAway/01	Help!
NPCSpeeches/RunningAway/02	Oh, no!
NPCSpeeches/RunningAway/03	Bandits!
NPCSpeeches/RunningAwayHurt/03	Please, no!
NPCSpeeches/RunningAwayHurt/04	Don't hurt me...
NPCSpeeches/Panic/01	Just take what you want...
NPCSpeeches/Panic/02	Why are you doing this...?
NPCSpeeches/Panic/03	Don't hurt me...
NPCSpeeches/Panic/04	Please... No...
NPCSpeeches/Panic/05	I beg you... stop...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Food/start/01	I'm hungry. Maybe there's something left in the fridge.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Food/start/02	Let's check if there's any food left.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Food/start/03	I should eat something.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Food/after/01	Enough for now.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Food/after/02	It's much better.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Radio_UNUSED/Hear/01	Someone turned on the radio...?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Radio_UNUSED/Hear/02	Huh? What's making this noise?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Radio_UNUSED/Hear/03	The radio's on?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Radio_UNUSED/TurnOff/01	It's better when it's quiet.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Radio_UNUSED/TurnOff/02	Shut up, you piece of junk.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Radio_UNUSED/TurnOff/03	Weird, did it turn on by itself?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Image/start/01	That old picture... I think it needs dusting.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Image/start/02	These old pictures got all dusty...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Image/end/01	Ah, I miss the good old times...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Image/end/02	Those days are over...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/start/01	I wonder if there are any meds left in the bath cabinet.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/start/02	I should take some pills from the bath cabinet.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/end/01	We're running short on meds...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/BathCabinet/end/02	Just one pill and I'm going back...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/start/Scavenger/00	There's gotta be something useful here...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/start/Scavenger/01	Maybe there's still something left?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/start/01	It bothers me that I've lost it, I've gotta find it...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/start/02	Where did I put that...?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/A/Scavenger/00	Maybe some food...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/A/Scavenger/01	Some meds...?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/A/Scavenger/02	What have we got here...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/A/00	Is it here...?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/B/Scavenger/00	This is trash...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/B/Scavenger/01	I won't need that!
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/B/Scavenger/02	Interesting...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/B/00	It must be somewhere!
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/C/Scavenger/00	Oh, this could come in handy...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/C/Scavenger/01	What's this? I'll take it...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/middle/C/00	I'm almost sure I saw it...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/end/Scavenger/00	Eh, all good stuff already taken, as usual.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/end/Scavenger/01	Could be better.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/end/Scavenger/02	Well, it's better than nothing.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/end/01	I will find it, eventually...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInFurniture/end/02	It's probably somewhere else.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInTrash/start/01	Maybe there's still some firewood left in that pile...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInTrash/start/02	Maybe I can still find something useful here...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInTrash/middle/A	Let's see...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInTrash/middle/B	Maybe this...?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInTrash/middle/C	This neither...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInTrash/end/01	Nothing.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SearchingItemsInTrash/end/02	Just some trash.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Scrap/01	Do you have springs? My boiler is broken.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Scrap/02	I'm looking for copper pipes.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Booze/01	You still have that cherry moonshine?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Booze/02	Can I clean wounds with this?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Meds/01	I need some bandages.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Meds/02	Do you have insulin?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Food/01	This rat looks rotten.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Food/02	These tomatoes are so small...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Other/01	Hmm... maybe this?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Other/02	Do I really need this?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Other/03	It looks useless.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Waiting/01	Do I have everything?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Waiting/02	I think I forgot something...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/LookingAtThings/Waiting/03	One more thing and I'll go back.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sink/start/02	When will we have the running water back...?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sink/start/01	I wonder if the water is running again...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sink/end/01	Still no water.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sink/end/02	One day they'll turn the water on.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/FreshAir/start/00	I need to get some fresh air.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/FreshAir/start/01	I'll get some air...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/FreshAir/middle/00	A bit windy tonight...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/FreshAir/middle/01	It's calm...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/FreshAir/end/00	It's so cold here, I should go back.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/FreshAir/end/01	No time for this, I should be back.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/ArmoryCheck/start	I'd better check the armory.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/ArmoryCheck/end	Everything seems to be in order.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CheckFriend/start/Soldier/start	I hope ^CharacterName^ isn't screwing around again.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CheckFriend/start/start	I wonder how ^CharacterName^ is doing.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CheckFriend/end/Soldier/end	Doing your job? Good.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CheckFriend/end/end	Everything's fine? Good.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Bed/NeedToSleep/00	I'm tired, I'd better go to bed.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Bed/NeedToSleep/01	I need some rest...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Bed/NeedToSleep/02	I'll try to have some sleep...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Bed/WakeUpNormally/00	Enough sleeping.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Bed/WakeUpNormally/01	I can't sleep...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Bed/WakeUpNormally/02	I haven't been able to sleep soundly since the shelling started...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Window/Start/00	I'll let some air into the room...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Window/Start/01	I wonder what the weather's like tonight...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Window/Looking/00	No suspicious people outside...? Good, we don't need any more trouble.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Window/Looking/01	I wonder if those buildings are empty.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Window/End/00	It's cold, I'd better close the window.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Window/End/01	All right, there's still plenty to do.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/Start/00	My legs went numb.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/Start/01	I need to sit down for a while.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/Middle/01	It isn't the comfiest seat, but it has to do.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/Middle/02	Just one more minute.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/Middle/03	I miss the old days...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/Middle/05	It doesn't make any sense.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/Middle/06	When will it end?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/End/00	Well, I can't sit forever.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Sitting/End/01	There are more important things to do...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Drinking/Start/00	I'm so thirsty...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Drinking/Start/01	Good I have this bottle...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Drinking/End/00	It's not easy to get water these days...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Drinking/End/01	I'll save the rest for later.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Book/Start/00	Glad I have this book.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Book/Start/01	A little break for another chapter...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Book/End/00	I hope I won't have to burn this book...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Book/End/01	I miss going to the library.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SickPatient/Start/00	I should check on that patient...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SickPatient/Start/01	That patient wasn't looking good...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SickPatient/Middle/00	Let's replace that, you'll feel more comfortable.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SickPatient/Middle/01	Here, it's your medication.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SickPatient/Middle/02	You look better.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SickPatient/End/00	Let me know if you need something.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SickPatient/End/01	You will surely get better soon.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/VerySickPatient/Start/00	Did someone call me...?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/VerySickPatient/Start/01	That patient needs me!
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/VerySickPatient/Middle/00	I'll do what I can...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/VerySickPatient/Middle/01	I know it hurts, you must stay strong.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/VerySickPatient/Middle/02	It's all I can do, there's not enough medicines.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/VerySickPatient/End/00	I wish there was more I could do...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/VerySickPatient/End/01	We lost a lot of supplies during the shelling...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/VerySickPatient/End/02	I feel so powerless...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/Start/00	I just need to be alone for a minute...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/Start/01	I... I need to check something...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/Middle/00	Why... Why does it happen to me...?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/Middle/01	I can't... I won't take it anymore...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/Middle/02	Please, let it end... Let it end already...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/End/00	Alright... I gotta hold on.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/End/01	It's better now. Guess I just needed that.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/End/02	Enough, I can't be such a crybaby.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/Interrupted/00	Oh... Excuse me...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/CrySadAlone/Interrupted/01	I... I was just looking for something...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/KillingRats/KillingRats_01	Bloody vermin!
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/KillingRats/KillingRats_02	Repulsive!
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/KillingRats/KillingRats_03	This place is crawling with these disgusting creatures!
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/FloorSleepOnBack/FloorSleepOnBack_01	There is no hope...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/FloorSleepOnBack/FloorSleepOnBack_02	I feel so miserable...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Pray/Pray_01	In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Pray/Pray_02	Lord, grant us strength to endure this trial...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Pray/Pray_03	And to forgive those who trespass against us...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Pray/Pray_04	So help us God. Amen.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SpecialSitting/Drinking	For peace and freedom! Cheers!
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SpecialSitting/Reading	Let's see... Where did I finish?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/SpecialSitting/Eating	I miss the dishes we ate before the war...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Fitness/Start/Start_01	A simple exercise to stay fit.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/Fitness/Start/Start_02	Time for some exercise!

E3/WelcomeMessage/Cheerful/02	Hey people! Did you miss me?
E3/Intro	War has driven us from our homes, took away everything. Fleeing the slaughter, the three of us meet by chance, taking shelter in this battered building.

This place seems safe enough to stay here for a while. First we should scour it, looking for supplies, especially food. When the night comes, someone should also search nearby buildings. If we find any materials, we could build some equipment we need to survive.

Note: let's be careful with strangers. People aren't as friendly as they used to be...
E3/EndingTitle	This is where TWoM press demo ends.
E3/Ending	Expect more complex experience from the final version in Q4 2014.

VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/1_Title	Hello, neighbors!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/1_Description	We live several blocks from here. We saw that you took refuge in this building, and since we're supposed to be neighbors, we decided to pay you a visit and say hello. We brought you some vegetables from our garden. Enjoy!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/2_Title	Will you help us reinforce our shelter?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/2_Description	Hello, it's us again. The military intensified shelling of our area and we decided we need to reinforce our improvised shelter in the cellar. We've got the necessary materials, but we could use an extra pair of hands. Maybe you could help us?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/3Y_Title	Thank you for your help!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/3Y_Description	We've come to see how you're doing and to thank you for your help. It feels much safer to sleep in our own reinforced shelter.

We were saving this bottle for some special occasion, but we discussed it and decided to give it to you, instead.
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/3N_Title	Please, help me bury my husband.
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/3N_Description	My husband is dead. Killed by an artillery shell. There was nothing I could do. What I can do now is give him a proper funeral.

VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/2N_Title	Take our mother to hospital!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/2N_Description	It's about our mother! We didn't find any medicine for her and now she's very, very sick! Please, you must take her to hospital! Please!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/3Y_Title	Thank you so much!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/3Y_Description	Thank you for your help, I feel much better now. I'd rather not think what would happen to my children if you hadn't helped me.
We haven't got much, but I saved up some coffee for my husband. He loves it, but he hasn't been home for a long time now. He's somewhere out there fighting and who knows when he can return, so why don't you take it instead?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/2Y_Postpone_Title	Have you found some food for us?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/2Y_Postpone_Description	We're very hungry, our tummies hurt. We can't find anything good to eat, so we've been eating all sorts of gross things in the last couple of days. Can you share some real food with us, please? Pretty please?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/1_Postpone_Title	Have you got medicine for mom?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/1_Postpone_Description	Mummy is getting weaker every day, she can't wait any longer! Please, can you give us medicine for her? Please!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/1_Title	Save people from a collapsed building!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/1_Description	Thank goodness you're here! A shell hit a tenement down the street and people are buried beneath the rubble. Please, help me pull them out! Every pair of hands is needed. We will organize a makeshift hospital for the wounded at my home. I have some beds and medical supplies. Will you help?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/2Y_Title	Can you spare some bandages?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/2Y_Description	Hello again. How are you doing? Thanks to your help all the wounded recovered and went back to their homes. One of them still needs bandages though, and I've run out. Could you spare any?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/3Y_Title	Thank you for saving my father!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/3Y_Description	Hi, you don't know me, but my father told me how you'd helped pull him out from the collapsed building and shared some bandages with him. If not for you, he would be dead now. I don't know how to thank you! I haven't got much, but please take these earrings. They belonged to my mother.
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/2Y_Postponed_Title	What about those bandages?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/2Y_Postponed_Description	It's me again, have you managed to get those bandages we spoke about? You'll save that man's life.
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/1_Title	Can you help me with something?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/1_Description	Hi there, neighbor. You aren't from around here, are you? I've come to tell you that there's an abandoned house nearby. The owners fled the city long ago when it was still possible. If you help me get inside, we might find something of value there. What do you say?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/2Y_Title	Perhaps you'll help me again?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/2Y_Description	It's me again. Last time it went quite well, so I thought you might want to help me again. I know of a rich family who managed to stock up on supplies before the war, but they selfishly don't share with anybody. Maybe we should pay them a visit?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/3Y_Title	You can't miss this opportunity!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/3Y_Description	There's another job. This time it's a real gold seam. It's a bit risky, but really worth it. A hospital warehouse, full of medical supplies! It's only lightly guarded at night - we can deal with that. Let's go!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/AidContainer/1_Title	I've got interesting news!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/AidContainer/1_Description	Good day to you! I live down the street and I noticed you're living in this abandoned building. I've got some news. There was a humanitarian aid drop last night. Most containers were confiscated by the rebels, but I know about one they missed. It landed in no man's land so it might be dangerous to get to it but under the cover of darkness we should be able to make it. I'll show you where it is if you help me carry supplies. Deal?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/AidContainer/2_Title	We're looking for a thief, do you know anything?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/AidContainer/2_Description	Citizens, several days ago someone from this neighborhood stole supplies from a humanitarian aid container. Those supplies are vital to us. There's a reward for help in seizing the culprit. One of your neighbors was reportedly sniffing around the container and we have reasons to believe he took those supplies. Can you confirm our suspicions?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/AidContainer/3N_Title	Thanks for your solidarity!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/AidContainer/3N_Description	Good to see you again! Thank you for not reporting on me to the rebel soldiers. You're good people. Please accept these cigarettes as a small token of my gratitude. They're really good, American!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/1_Title	Can you help me board up my windows?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/1_Description	I live nearby with my daughter. I've heard rumors of looters pillaging houses and raping women. I can lock the doors but they could get inside through the windows. Can you help me board them up? My husband was taken by the rebels in the first year of the war and hasn't returned yet. We're all alone, please help us!
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/2Y_Title	Can you protect us, please?
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/2Y_Description	It's me again. Yesterday, I saw a band of shady-looking types watching my house. I'm so scared! They might try to rob us or worse. I have a teenage daughter! Can you please protect us for a night or two? You can use my husband's hunting shotgun.
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/3Y_Title	We're moving, thank you for everything.
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/3Y_Description	Thank you so much for protecting us. My sister and her husband came to visit us. They live in another part of town and invited us to stay with them. I think we'll be safer there, so we're leaving. But before we go, I wanted to thank you and give you my husband's shotgun along with the rest of our ammunition. We won't need it anymore, I hope.
VisitDescriptions/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/1_Postpone_Title	Can you help us now?

VisitDescriptions/_DwellerCandidateVisit_title	Can I stay with you?
VisitDescriptions/GiveWood_title	I have some wood to spare
VisitDescriptions/GiveWood	We have to help each other, especially in times like these. I had some trees in the garden, but it's getting colder every day, so I decided to cut them for firewood, before anyone else would. I can share some of it with you. Maybe next time you will help me out, eh?
VisitDescriptions/GiveFood_title	I've got food to share
VisitDescriptions/GiveFood	You won't believe it, but some charity organization was handing out food in the market square! I thought they'd given up on us. I took as much as they would give before Grazni mortars started firing and everyone had to run for cover. I was lucky to have made it.
VisitDescriptions/GiveBooks_title	Will you save my books?
VisitDescriptions/GiveBooks	I am moving to a different part of the city with my family. We took all we could carry, but we have to leave some things behind, including my large collection of books. Maybe I could leave them with you for safekeeping? Otherwise, I'm afraid someone will burn them when it gets cold. They could help you pass the time, and I'd come back for them after the fighting is over. What do you say?

VisitDescriptions/DwellerNeedFuneral	It's about my wife... She was gathering firewood when she was shot by a sniper. There was nothing I could do to help her. The least we can do now is give her a proper funeral... Let's show those bastards that they can't take away our dignity and that we're not afraid of snipers. Will you come with me?
VisitDescriptions/MedsForAnna_title	Could you keep these meds for my friend?
VisitDescriptions/MedsForAnna	I'm looking for my friend, Anna. She used to live here before the war. I was hoping to see her. She was always rather sickly and medications are getting ever harder to come by, so I brought her some. Maybe you could keep them and give them to her if she comes?
VisitDescriptions/WoundedBrother_title	Help! My brother is wounded!

DLC/Description/01	Canadian-American artist Gabriel “Specter” Reese as a kid sketched and painted the streets of Montreal. Nowadays his work has been featured in countless gallery shows and he’s been commissioned to do several large public works in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
DLC/Description/02	Since the early nineties, SeaCreative whose real name is Fabrizio Sarti has been painting walls and train cars in and around Milan, Italy. Today SeaCreative paints and shows his own characters, not just in the more conventional setting of an exhibition, but still throughout the urban setting of Milan.
DLC/Description/03	Emir personally experienced war as a boy. He began to repulse the hatred for war by crushing charcoal on large formats. His compositions are reflections on human condition and our society during the war.
DLC/Description/04	M-City is a project of Mariusz Waras, born 1978 in Gdynia, Poland. His projects including several hundred murals, may be seen in the streets of Warsaw, Gdańsk, Berlin, Paris, Jakarta, Sao Paulo, New York, Bolzano, London and Prague, as well as in art galleries.
DLC/Description/05	Man behind M-City project Mariusz Waras is is also a curator of the 238x504 billboard gallery in Gdynia as well as an archivist and collector of Polish street art.
DLC/Description/06	Fauxreel is a self tought Canadian artist. He creates stunning photo based street art to provoke reflection upon many issues like identity, social relationships and the spaces that we inhabit.
DLC/Description/07	Mariusz Waras is also a freelance graphic artist, frequently awarded in various contests. In 2008 Tristan Manco, an international art expert included him in the official list of the worlds's most important artists of the stencil-graffiti scene.
DLC/Description/08	In the street, Specter is known for precise installations that revitalize forgotten places. The work is as much about the piece as it is about where it is placed. He specifically chooses the environments for his work and it often evolves to reflect the chosen location.
DLC/Description/09	Large formats that Emir utilizes in his work allowed for better impact making very contrasted images quite impressive in an expressionist way.
DLC/Description/10	Mateusz Walus is a young and very talented artist from Poland. He is insanely passionate about art and games. Mateusz created some of the graphics used in This War of Mine.

Countless civilians are stranded in the city. Food and vital resources are running out, and every day is a struggle for survival.

Christo and his daughter Iskra were driven from their home by soldiers. In search of a place to stay, they chanced upon an abandoned building and decided to make it their temporary home.
DailyLog/IntroMessageChildWithProtector_02	Every day is a struggle for survival in besieged Pogoren. Snipers prowl the city. Shellings are frequent. Crime is on the rise as supplies are becoming ever harder to come by. To make things worse, winter is setting in and there is no central heating.

In these dire circumstances, old Henrik is trying to keep his grandson Ivano alive and well. While searching for shelter they met Arica, a girl who came to Pogoren fleeing military persecution. They decided to stick together for the time being, and have been occupying a recently abandoned building.

Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_01/LookedAfter_01	It's horrible here... I don't want to be here anymore!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_01/Caregiver_03	We can't leave the city yet, but it won't be long now.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_01/LookedAfter_02	How do you know?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_01/Caregiver_04	I think I heard it on the radio, or at the market.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_01/Lookedafter_03	Really? How much longer do we have to stay here?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_01/Caregiver_05	Not very long, you'll see!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_01/Caregiver_01	Why do you look so grim ^CharacterName^?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_01/Caregiver_02	You're not the only who has it hard you know.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_01/LookedAfter_01	I know, but I feel so lonely...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_01/LookedAfter_02	And I'm really scared. I don't want to die!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_01/Caregiver_03	Everyone has to die one day, kid. Don't be a coward, get a grip!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_01/LookedAfter_03	But... but...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_01/Caregiver_04	Oh come on, stop crying already!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_01	What are you going to do after the war?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_01	I don't know...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_02	I'll go to Paris. Do you know what's there?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_02	No.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_03	Not one, but TWO theme parks. Aaaand...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_04	...they're trying to outdo each other ALL the time.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_03	Can I go with you?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/Caregiver_05	We'll see... You'd have to behave...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_02/LookedAfter_04	I will, I promise!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/Caregiver_01	^CharacterName^, do you want to hear a story?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/LookedAfter_01	...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/Caregiver_02	There was once a Mouse who was very scared of a Cat.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/Caregiver_03	She lived in a small hole in the wall.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/LookedAfter_02	Like us...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/Caregiver_04	And she also only dared to go out at night.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/Caregiver_05	But one day, she heard that the Cat is no more!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/LookedAfter_03	And she lived happily ever after?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/Caregiver_06	No. She died of overeating.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/LookedAfter_04	But she died happy!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Homie_03/Caregiver_07	Oh yeah!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_01	What's wrong, ^CharacterName^?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/LookedAfter_01	I miss school.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_02	It took a war to hear a kid say that.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/LookedAfter_02	No, I mean, I miss my friends.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_03	I miss my friends too. But it's not all bad.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/LookedAfter_03	How so?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_04	I have new friends now.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/LookedAfter_04	...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_05	And when it's over, we'll have even more friends.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/LookedAfter_05	Really? Who?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_02/Caregiver_06	All the people who will have lived through this will be our friends.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/Caregiver_01	Hey, ^CharacterName^, what's up?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/LookedAfter_01	Nothing.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/Caregiver_02	Look, I got a kitten for you!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/LookedAfter_02	It's a piece of rug.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/Caregiver_03	But it needs a hug!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/LookedAfter_03	That's stupid.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/Caregiver_04	...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/LookedAfter_04	I know you wanted to make me laugh. I'm sorry.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Altruistic_03/Caregiver_05	I just... Everything will be fine, you'll see.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_01	^CharacterName^, what's the matter?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/LookedAfter_01	I'm scared.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_02	Me too. But I won't give up.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/LookedAfter_02	Does dying hurt?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_03	You are not going to die!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/LookedAfter_03	It does.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_04	Sometimes. But I will not let you die.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/LookedAfter_04	Grown-ups lie all the time.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_05	...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_02/Caregiver_06	I promise I'll do everything to protect you.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/Caregiver_01	You know, I fell from a tree when I was little.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/LookedAfter_01	I did too. So what?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/Caregiver_02	But did you fall on someone?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/Caregiver_03	I fell on my teacher.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/LookedAfter_02	On someone?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/LookedAfter_03	Really?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/Caregiver_04	Yeah. He came to ask me why I wasn’t at school.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/LookedAfter_04	Wow!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/Caregiver_05	And I broke his collarbone.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/LookedAfter_05	He must have been really mad at you.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Survivalist_03/Caregiver_06	I don't know. I changed schools.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_01	Stop moaning, ^CharacterName^.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_01	I don't want to be here anymore!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_02	You have no idea how lucky you are.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_02	What?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_03	Others have it much worse.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_03	So what!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_04	At least we have a home.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_04	This is no home!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_05	It's the best we have.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/LookedAfter_05	I hate you!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_02/Caregiver_06	Well, that's better. No more sniveling!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/Caregiver_01	^CharacterName^, quit moping.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/LookedAfter_01	I'm not.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/Caregiver_02	You're moping like a moper.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/LookedAfter_02	What's a moper?
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/Caregiver_03	You are. A proper moper.
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/LookedAfter_03	Don't call me that!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/Caregiver_04	Hey, it's not my fault!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/LookedAfter_04	If I were big, I would...
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/Caregiver_05	You would mope the floor with me!
Dialogues/KidComfort/Egoist_03/LookedAfter_05	You bet I would!
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Interaction_Casual_NewDweller_01/A_01	Hello {mr|mister}{fr|ma'am}.
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Interaction_Casual_NewDweller_01/A_02	Will you live with us now?
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Interaction_Casual_NewDweller_01/B_01	Yes, it seems I will.
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Interaction_Casual_NewDweller_01/A_03	Yaaay! I can show you around if you like.
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Interaction_Casual_NewDweller_01/B_03	You are very kind, thank you.
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_Dweller_Weak/A_01	You look so tired, are you ok?
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_Dweller_Weak/B_01	I'm a little weak.
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_Dweller_Weak/B_02	But I will be alright, so cheer up.
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_Dweller_Weak/A_02	Okay, I will find a potion of strength for you!
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_Parent_06/A_01	What does this new thing do?
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_Parent_06/B_01	I can't tell you, it's a secret!
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_Parent_06/A_02	Oh come on! Tell me, tell me, tell me!
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_ParentDied_01/A_01	Tell me!
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_ParentDied_01/B_01	I'm sorry to tell you this, but...
Dialogues/Kids_Dialogue_Casual_ParentDied_01/A_02	No! It's not true! You're lying!
Dialogues/Kids_Farewell/A_01	I'm scared!
Dialogues/Kids_Farewell/B_01	Don't worry, everything will be alright.
Dialogues/Kids_Farewell/B_02	These people will take good care of you, you'll see!

Dialogues/Kids_Casual/NotBusy/13/A_02	But, ^CharacterName^...
Dialogues/Kids_Casual/NotBusy/13/B_02	End of discussion.

Dialogues/Learning/Fuel/A_03	Wood works best, but if there isn’t any, you can use books or other components.
Dialogues/Learning/Fuel/B_03	Books?
Dialogues/Learning/Fuel/A_04	Only if really necessary, alright?
Dialogues/Learning/Fuel/B_04	Alright.
Dialogues/Learning/Fertilizer/A_01	Let me show you something, ^CharacterName^.
Dialogues/Learning/Fertilizer/B_01	What’s that?
Dialogues/Learning/Fertilizer/A_02	Look, that’s how we make fertilizer.
Dialogues/Learning/Fertilizer/B_02	What do we need it for?
Dialogues/Learning/Fertilizer/A_03	We use it for growing herbs or vegetables.
Dialogues/Learning/Fertilizer/B_03	Oh, I see.
Dialogues/Learning/Herbs/A_01	Here ^CharacterName^, I’ll teach you how to grow herbs in our garden.
Dialogues/Learning/Herbs/B_01	Okay.
Dialogues/Learning/Herbs/A_02	See, it’s not very difficult.
Dialogues/Learning/Herbs/B_02	Yeah, I think I can do it…
Dialogues/Learning/Herbs/A_03	Just remember to use some fertilizer and water.
Dialogues/Learning/Herbs/B_03	I get it.
Dialogues/Learning/Vegetables/A_01	Would you like to learn how to grow vegetables, ^CharacterName^?
Dialogues/Learning/Vegetables/B_01	Sure! Can we grow watermelons ^CharacterName^?
Dialogues/Learning/Vegetables/A_02	Eh… no, not really. But we can grow other veggies like carrots and parsley…
Dialogues/Learning/Vegetables/B_02	I don’t like parsley...
Dialogues/Learning/Vegetables/A_03	It’ll be very tasty in soups and stews, you’ll see.
Dialogues/Learning/Vegetables/B_03	If you say so…
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Stove/A_01	^CharacterName^, let’s melt some snow!
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Stove/B_01	Why?
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Stove/A_02	So that we have water to drink and cook.
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Stove/B_02	Oh, ok.
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Stove/A_03	So, what do we need to do before we drink the water?
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Stove/B_03	Hmm… boil it so that there are no germs?
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Stove/A_04	Yes. And we also filter it to make sure it’s clean.
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Collector/A_01	Hey ^CharacterName^, ever wondered how this works?
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Collector/B_01	Yeah! Will you show me?
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Collector/A_02	It’s very simple. You see, rainwater is collected in the barrel...
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Collector/A_03	And if we put a water filter here, we will have some clean water!
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Collector/B_02	Wow, that is really simple!
Dialogues/Learning/Water_Collector/A_04	Remember to replace the filters often though, they get used up quickly.
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/A_01	Wanna learn something useful, ^CharacterName^?
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/B_01	Yeah!
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/A_02	Ok, then. Here’s how you make bandages, see?
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/B_02	I see.
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/A_03	Do you know why we use alcohol here?
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/B_03	Why?
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/A_04	We use it as a disinfectant.
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/B_04	A dis-what?
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/A_05	Disinfectant. It kills germs.
Dialogues/Learning/Bandages/B_05	Oh, I understand.
Dialogues/Learning/HomegrownTobacco/A_01	Can you help me with something, ^CharacterName^?
Dialogues/Learning/HomegrownTobacco/B_01	Yes, what is it?
Dialogues/Learning/HomegrownTobacco/A_02	I’m making tobacco from herbs. We can use it to make cigarettes.
Dialogues/Learning/HomegrownTobacco/B_02	What for?
Dialogues/Learning/HomegrownTobacco/A_03	So that we can exchange them for food or some other things.
Dialogues/Learning/HomegrownTobacco/B_03	Like toys?
Dialogues/Learning/HomegrownTobacco/A_04	Well… yes, that too.
Dialogues/Learning/HomegrownTobacco/B_04	Yay!
Dialogues/Learning/Cigarettes/A_01	I’ll teach you to make cigarettes, which we can later trade, okay?
Dialogues/Learning/Cigarettes/B_01	Okay. But aren’t cigarettes bad for health?
Dialogues/Learning/Cigarettes/A_02	They are, but some people like them. Now focus.
Dialogues/Learning/Cigarettes/B_02	Okay... what should I do then?
Dialogues/Learning/Cigarettes/A_03	First of all, grab some rolling paper and place tobacco on it, like this.
Dialogues/Learning/Cigarettes/A_04	Now roll it up with your fingers after wetting the side of the paper.
Dialogues/Learning/Rollups/A_01	Do you want to learn how to roll up smokes, ^CharacterName^?
Dialogues/Learning/Rollups/B_01	Roll up smokes?
Dialogues/Learning/Rollups/A_02	Make crude cigarettes.
Dialogues/Learning/Rollups/B_02	Oh… Why would I want to learn that? Cigarettes smell bad.
Dialogues/Learning/Rollups/A_03	They do… but we could get things we need in exchange for them.
Dialogues/Learning/Rollups/B_03	Well… ok then.
Dialogues/Learning/Rollups/A_04	Great! We just need some home-grown tobacco and some rolling paper…
Dialogues/Learning/QualityRollups/A_01	^CharacterName^, let me show you how to make quality roll-ups.
Dialogues/Learning/QualityRollups/B_01	Don’t we do them like normal cigarettes?
Dialogues/Learning/QualityRollups/A_02	We do, but we use equal parts of real tobacco and homemade tobacco.
Dialogues/Learning/QualityRollups/B_02	Why?
Dialogues/Learning/QualityRollups/A_03	To save real tobacco. It’s difficult to get nowadays.
Dialogues/Learning/QualityRollups/B_03	Why not just use homemade tobacco then?
Dialogues/Learning/QualityRollups/A_04	Because the taste will be better if we mix the two.
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/A_01	Would you like to become a hunter, ^CharacterName^?
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/B_01	Sure I would! Will I get a rifle?
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/A_02	No… but I can teach you to set traps.
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/B_02	Wow, bear traps?
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/A_03	Eh… no. Traps for small animals.
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/B_03	Like rabbits?
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/A_04	Sort of. More like rats.
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/B_04	Ewww… why?
Dialogues/Learning/RawFood/A_05	They’re pests. Also, we can trade them.

StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/content/Kids/01	There's something strange about ^CharacterName^ today.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ is so silent today… I wonder what happened.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/sad/Kids/01	Why won't anyone tell me what happened at night?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/DefencelessVictim/spectator/sad/Kids/02	I'm big, why is everyone treating me like a kid?!

StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/content/Kids/01	I can never wait for ^CharacterName^ to come back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ won't tell me what happened at night.

StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Civilian/spectator/depression/Kids/00	I'm worried... something is different about ^CharacterName^ today.

StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ was in trouble during the night, I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to go out again!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/sad/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ should stay home tonight, it's scary outside.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Bandit/spectator/depression/Kids/00	I overheard ^CharacterName^ was in danger during the night! I want {mr|him}{fr|her} to stay home!

StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/KilledSomeone/Soldier/spectator/depression/Kids/01	If the soldiers come looking for ^CharacterName^, they'll hurt us!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ said it’s just a flesh wound.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ showed me the scratches and said they will make an awesome scar!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Sad/Kids/00	I saw ^CharacterName^ bleeding...

StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Sad/Kids/02	Someone should really, really look after ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Sad/Kids/03	^CharacterName^ needs some bandages as soon as possible.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Depression/Kids/00	It must hurt ^CharacterName^ a lot!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Depression/Kids/01	Is ^CharacterName^ going to die..?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Depression/Kids/02	They have to do something about ^CharacterName^! {mr|He}{fr|She} is in pain all the time!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerWounded/spectator/Depression/Kids/03	I saw ^CharacterName^ cry in pain! {mr|He}{fr|She} needs a doctor!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerHungry/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} will eat soon enough!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerHungry/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} is not hungry at all!

StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerHungry/spectator/Sad/Kids/02	^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} is not hungry at all, but I don’t believe it…
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerHungry/spectator/Sad/Kids/03	^CharacterName^ should eat something, we all need to eat.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerHungry/spectator/Depression/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ complains how hungry {mr|he}{fr|she} is.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerHungry/spectator/Depression/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ is unhappy because {mr|he}{fr|she} is hungry.

StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerHungry/spectator/Depression/Kids/03	^CharacterName^ is so thin! I can see {mr|his}{fr|her} bones now!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/LateFromScavenge/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ is back! ^CharacterName^ is back!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/LateFromScavenge/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back! I was told not to worry, but I did anyway!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/LateFromScavenge/spectator/Sad/Kids/00	I was really, really worried!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/LateFromScavenge/spectator/Sad/Kids/01	I was scared you weren't going to come back!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/LateFromScavenge/spectator/Depression/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ was away so long, I even cried!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/LateFromScavenge/spectator/Depression/Kids/01	I thought I'd never see ^CharacterName^ again...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ is coughing a bit, but {mr|he}{fr|she} says it's nothing serious.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} is a little bit sick, but will be okay soon.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Sad/Kids/00	I heard that ^CharacterName^ is very sick. I don’t want {mr|him}{fr|her} to be sick.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Sad/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ wanted me to keep away from {mr|him}{fr|her}...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Sad/Kids/02	I don't think ^CharacterName^ is getting any better at all!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Sad/Kids/03	I saw ^CharacterName^ having really bad shivers! And {mr|he}{fr|she} is sweating a lot!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Depression/Kids/00	I don’t want ^CharacterName^ to die!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Depression/Kids/01	Can somebody help ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} looks really ill!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Depression/Kids/02	Is ^CharacterName^ going to die because of that sickness?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerSickness/spectator/Depression/Kids/03	Can't we just take ^CharacterName^ to the hospital? {mr|He}{fr|She} doesn't look well!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	Someone was trying to break into our house at night!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	I woke up at night, when I heard people shouting and fighting. I was scared.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Sad/Kids/00	There were some bad people outside at night.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Sad/Kids/01	Will those bad people come back again?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Sad/Kids/02	I was scared of those people who came at night.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Sad/Kids/03	I don't want those bad people to come back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Depression/Kids/00	Why did they attack us? Why won't they leave us alone?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Depression/Kids/01	I'm afraid of those burglars who came at night.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Depression/Kids/02	I don't feel safe here, I hope those bad men won't come back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/0-3/spectator/Depression/Kids/03	I was really scared of those people at night.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	Some bad men came at night, but we were brave.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	Bandits can’t hurt us here, our house is like a fortress.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Sad/Kids/00	Who were the bad people that came to us at night?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Sad/Kids/01	Why did those people try to rob us? We don't have much.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Sad/Kids/02	I hope those burglars don't come back...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Sad/Kids/03	I wish there were no thieves trying to rob us at night.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Depression/Kids/00	Why won't they leave us alone? Why?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Depression/Kids/01	This wouldn't happen in our old house.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Depression/Kids/02	I'm small, I can't fight big strong burglars.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/4-6/spectator/Depression/Kids/03	If they come again, they'll hurt us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	If only we could kill them so that they don't come back!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	We won't let the bandits beat us. We won't!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Sad/Kids/00	Bad people hurt us! Why?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Sad/Kids/01	What if those bad men come back? What then?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Sad/Kids/02	Can we do something more to stop those men from hurting us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Sad/Kids/03	I'm scared those bad people will come back and hurt us even more!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Depression/Kids/00	I want those bad people to stop hurting us, but what can I do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Depression/Kids/01	It's horrible, those bad people can hurt us whenever they like!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Depression/Kids/02	I wish we could kill all those bad people!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/ShelterAttacked/7-100/spectator/Depression/Kids/03	I hate those burglars, I want them all to die!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/hero/sad/Kids/00	I can't sleep at night...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/hero/sad/Kids/01	I'm afraid to fall asleep...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/hero/depression/Kids/00	I can't sleep, I'm afraid a bomb will hit our home.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/hero/depression/Kids/01	People are shooting at night... what if they come to kill us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/spectator/sad/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ can't sleep at night. {mr|He}{fr|She} looks pale.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Insomnia/spectator/sad/Kid/01	^CharacterName^ just rolls from one side to another all night. {mr|He}{fr|She} can't sleep.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftShelter/spectator/sad/Kids/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ leave us? Where did {mr|he}{fr|she} go?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftShelter/spectator/sad/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ will be back soon, right? Right?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftShelter/spectator/depression/Kids/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ leave us? I don't understand...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftShelter/spectator/depression/Kids/01	I hate ^CharacterName^! Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} leave us alone?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Drunk/spectator/sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ shouldn't drink alcohol...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Drunk/spectator/sad/Kids/01	I don't like it when ^CharacterName^ drinks alcohol!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Drunk/spectator/depression/Kids/00	I hate it when ^CharacterName^ drinks!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Drunk/spectator/depression/Kids/01	Why does {mr|he}{fr|she} have to drink?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/spectator/sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ took all we had and ran away! How could {mr|he}{fr|she}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/spectator/sad/Kids/01	I thought ^CharacterName^ was our friend, but {mr|he}{fr|she} is nothing more than a dirty thief!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/spectator/depression/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ betrayed us, and stole from us. I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/spectator/depression/Kids/01	How could ^CharacterName^ steal from us? I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Affray/spectator/sad/Kids/00	I overheard an argument last night. ^CharacterName^ was really mean...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Affray/spectator/sad/Kids/01	Someone was shouting really loudly last night. I wonder what happened.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Affray/spectator/depression/Kids/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ scream so much yesterday?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Affray/spectator/depression/Kids/01	Why was ^CharacterName^ so mean? It makes no sense at all!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Suicide/spectator/sad/Kids/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ do it? Why?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Suicide/spectator/sad/Kids/01	How could ^CharacterName^ leave me like that?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Suicide/spectator/depression/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}... Will I die too?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Suicide/spectator/depression/Kids/01	I hate ^CharacterName^ for leaving me like that! I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Cry/spectator/sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ was sad and cried, and it made me sad too...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Cry/spectator/sad/Kids/01	I wish ^CharacterName^ wouldn’t cry, but I don't know what to do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Cry/spectator/depression/Kids/00	When I hear ^CharacterName^ cry, I feel like crying too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Cry/spectator/depression/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ cried all night. It must be really bad. Are we going to die?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Fight/spectator/sad/Kids/00	Everybody's so silent today...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Fight/spectator/sad/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ has a black eye. What happened at night?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Fight/spectator/depression/Kids/00	How could ^CharacterName^ do that?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/Trauma/Fight/spectator/depression/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ is a bully!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/RunAway/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ ran away from us, but I think {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/RunAway/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	We don't need ^CharacterName^ anyway, do we?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/RunAway/Sad/Kids/00	Where did ^CharacterName^ go?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/RunAway/Sad/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ left us because we were mean to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/RunAway/Depression/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ left us, but how can {mr|he}{fr|she} live alone?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/RunAway/Depression/Kids/01	We should've been nicer to ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/Angry/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ is upset, I hope it's not my fault!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/Angry/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	Maybe if I play with ^CharacterName^, it will cheer {mr|him}{fr|her} up!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/Angry/Sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ is really upset, I wonder why...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/Angry/Sad/Kids/01	I don't want ^CharacterName^ to be angry...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/Angry/Depression/Kids/00	Does ^CharacterName^ hate us?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/DwellerAngry/Angry/Depression/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ looks very angry, I hope it's not my fault.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	Everyone around here is hungry, but I’m sure we will eat soon!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	We're all hungry... a pizza would be great!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Sad/Kids/00	Everyone is hungry, but we have nothing to eat...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Sad/Kids/01	Can we get something to eat now, please?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Sad/Kids/02	It's sad when everyone is hungry...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Sad/Kids/03	We have to go shopping! We need food!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Depression/Kids/00	I don't understand why we have nothing to eat...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Depression/Kids/01	I don't want anybody to be hungry anymore!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Depression/Kids/02	Our tummies are rumbling, we must eat something... but what?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupHungry/Depression/Kids/03	Everybody is hungry and I don't know what to do...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	The ancient warriors were proud of their scars, we should be proud too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	Everyone is bruised, but it's nothing, we are strong.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Sad/Kids/00	Everyone around here is hurt...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Sad/Kids/01	I wish we had something to make the pain go away.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Sad/Kids/02	I don't want anyone to suffer, but what can I do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Sad/Kids/03	If only I could do something to help everyone get better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Depression/Kids/00	Why do people hurt each other? Why can't they stop? Why?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Depression/Kids/01	This is bad! We must all go to see a doctor!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Depression/Kids/02	We must all go to the hospital!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupWounded/Depression/Kids/03	Why do bad people hurt us? We're not bothering anyone!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	We won't give in to the sickness, we'll be strong!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	At school there was a time when everyone was sick at the same time!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Sad/Kids/00	Everyone around here is sick...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Sad/Kids/01	Everybody is so pale...
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Sad/Kids/02	Why is everybody sick? Can't we do something?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Sad/Kids/03	Has everyone got the flu?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Depression/Kids/00	This sickness is serious, we need help!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Depression/Kids/01	We really need a doctor to come to see us!
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Depression/Kids/02	We need pills or something, but where can we get them?
StateSpeeches/MoraleEvents/GroupEvents/GroupSick/Depression/Kids/03	I don't want anyone to die! I don’t want to!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/good_trade_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ helped some people who were in trouble. Maybe they'll be our friends?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/good_trade_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	If we help each other out like last night, the soldiers can't win!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ brought some fine stuff. I wonder how {mr|he}{fr|she} got it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/002_petrol_station/robbed_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ didn't talk much about last night, but {mr|he}{fr|she} brought some nice things.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ says we should be kind to other people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ said we can't help everyone, but at least we have to try.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/02	The priest said that every kind deed brings us closer to heaven.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/00	Some hungry man asked ^CharacterName^ for food, but we are hungry too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/01	We're not the only hungry people in the city...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/004_coward/refuse_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/02	I wish we had more food...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/help_spectator/Content/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ freed some kidnapped women! {mr|He}{fr|She}'s a hero!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/help_spectator/Content/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ is very brave!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/005_scav_domek_kidnapers/help_spectator/Content/Kids/02	If I'm ever kidnapped, ^CharacterName^ will save me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/012_scav_domek_hotel/help_spectator/Content/Kids/00	No one is as brave as ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/012_scav_domek_hotel/help_spectator/Content/Kids/01	Fighting evil men and rescuing those in need is what ^CharacterName^ does!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/013_construction_site/kill_snipers_spectator/Content/Kids/00	The snipers kill many people, but they couldn't kill ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/013_construction_site/kill_snipers_spectator/Content/Kids/01	Now the snipers will be afraid to come to that construction site.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Sad/Kids/00	I wonder where those old people get all the good things.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Sad/Kids/01	The kind old people were generous to ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Sad/Kids/02	It's nice that people share what they have with us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Depression/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ looks sad, despite {mr|him}{fr|her} bringing so much stuff.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Depression/Kids/01	I think ^CharacterName^ isn't telling me the whole truth...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/robbed_spectator/Depression/Kids/02	^CharcterName^ wouldn't have lied to me, would {mr|he}{fr|she}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/spared_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ visited those friendly old people again. They're fine!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ said those nice old people who shared with us are in heaven.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/01	Those old people won't share with us anymore... they're gone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/014_old_couple/seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/02	^CharacterName^ looks sad. I think {mr|he}{fr|she} liked those old people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Sad/Kids/00	Something ^CharacterName^ saw made {mr|him}{fr|her} sad, but I don't know what it was.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Sad/Kids/01	I wonder what made ^CharacterName^ so sad.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Sad/Kids/02	I don't know why ^CharacterName^ won't tell me what {mr|he}{fr|she} saw...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Depression/Kids/00	Something really bad must've happened last night. ^CharacterName^ looked really pale.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Depression/Kids/01	I heard that ^CharacterName^ saw a soldier hurting someone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_hurt_spectator/Depression/Kids/02	The soldiers are evil and hurt people! I hope they all die!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ is a hero!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	The soldiers can't hurt anyone when ^CharacterName^ is around!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/015_violator/girl_safe_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/02	The soldiers better run when they see ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ told me {mr|he}{fr|she} saw a man being shot by a sniper.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Sad/Kids/01	I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to risk going there again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Sad/Kids/02	That Sniper Junction is really dangerous.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Depression/Kids/00	I don't want ^CharacterName^ to get shot by a sniper!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Depression/Kids/01	^CharacterName^ shouldn't go to that dangerous place again!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_not_help_spectator/Depression/Kids/02	Let's just stay here, let's not take risks.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ saved a man who was shot by a sniper.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/01	That man was lucky ^CharacterName^ was there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_help_spectator/Content_Cheerful/Kids/02	I hate snipers! I'm glad ^CharacterName^ saved that man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/00	It's too dangerous to go to that place!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/01	I'm scared ^CharacterName^ might not come back next time...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/016_sniper/man_seen_dead_spectator/Sad_Depression/Kids/02	What if some sniper kills ^CharacterName^? What then?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/content/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ brought some supplies from the hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/content/Kids/01	The hospital still helps people like us. That's good!
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/sad/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ is sad because of all the wounded people {mr|he}{fr|she} saw.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/sad/Kids/01	The hospital is a depressing place.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/depression/Kids/00	Why is ^CharacterName^ sad? What happened at the hospital?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/stolen/spectator/depression/Kids/01	What troubles ^CharacterName^?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/content/Kids/00	^CharacterName^ shared some of our stuff with the doctor at the hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/content/Kids/01	Now that doctor can help more people.
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/sad/Kids/00	I don't know if it was a good idea to give away our things...
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/sad/Kids/01	What if someone gets ill or hurt?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/depression/Kids/00	Don't they have enough stuff at the hospital? Do they need our stuff too?
StateSpeeches/MoraleQuests/018_hospital/helped/spectator/depression/Kids/01	Aren't we supposed to get help from the hospital, rather than the other way around?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I don't want ^CharacterName^ to die. I wish I could help {mr|him}{fr|her} get better, but what can I do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Why doesn't someone help ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} needs to go to see a doctor!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	^CharacterName^ is coughing all the time, {mr|he}{fr|she} will make us all sick too!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	If ^CharacterName^ dies, I'll never forgive {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ is sick. I think {mr|he}{fr|she} should go to see the doctor.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	^CharacterName^ is coughing a lot, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} gets better soon.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	^CharacterName^ is very, very ill. I'm scared. Why isn't the doctor coming?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	I'm so worried about my little ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} is very ill, and in these conditions... No, it’s best not to even think about it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I feel really sick... Am I dying? I don't want to die...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Am I getting any better? I don't think I am...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I don't wanna be sick anymore, why can't I get better?! Why can't I go to see the doctor?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I don't want to lie in bed, I don't want to be sick! Why doesn't someone help me?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I don't feel well... I think I should go to see the doctor...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerSickness/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	I'm sick. I don't wanna be sick. Can I have some pills or something?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I think ^CharacterName^ robbed someone, but {mr|he}{fr|she} won't tell me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	Nobody tells me anything! I asked ^CharacterName^ where {mr|he}{fr|she} got all those things, but {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't say.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestGarage/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ was in a garage, and brought home some interesting things!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I'm worried ^CharacterName^ lied to me about where {mr|he}{fr|she} got all those things, but why would {mr|he}{fr|she}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	^CharacterName^ said some old people gave {mr|him}{fr|her} some things to help us, but I don't believe {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestOldCouple/Robbed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ visited some nice people, and they gave {mr|him}{fr|her} some of their things. {mr|He}{fr|She} is sad because {mr|he}{fr|she} had nothing to give them to thank them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Everyone in the city is hungry... It's so sad...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	How could ^CharacterName^ give away our food like that?! That was stupid!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/GiveFood/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ has a good heart and gave some food to a hungry, homeless man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I'm afraid of hungry, homeless people. They might eat you if you're not careful.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	^CharacterName^ met some dirty beggar, who was very rude to {mr|him}{fr|her} and tried to steal some food! We gotta watch out.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSquat/Refuse/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ met some hungry beggar, but {mr|he}{fr|she} could not help him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Aggresive/00	Damn those soldiers! They think they can do whatever they want! Fucking criminals!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I saw a soldier abusing a girl... We had better avoid those pigs.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	What happened to that girl was terrible but that soldier would have hurt me worse, had I interfered.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	What happened to that girl happens every day in wartime. If I'd tried to help her, that soldier would've killed me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I feel sorry for that girl... but what was I supposed to do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	I saw a soldier abusing some poor girl. I'm just glad it wasn't anyone I know.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	That soldier was so cruel to that girl... And I was too powerless to stop him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	That pig took advantage of a defenseless girl but I couldn't stop him... It would've put us all in danger if I had.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	I couldn't help that girl. I couldn't do anything. I felt so powerless.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	What that soldier did to that poor girl... how can anyone be so cruel? If only I was strong enough to save her...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	There was nothing ^CharacterName^ could do to save that girl.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/01	It's so sad that ^CharacterName^ couldn't save that girl.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	What that soldier did to that poor girl... how can anyone be so cruel? If only ^CharacterName^ had helped her...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	Poor girl... I can't stop thinking about what happened to her...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I pity that girl... but that soldier would have done much worse to ^CharacterName^, had {mr|he}{fr|she} interfered.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Poor girl... We should avoid those cruel military scumbags.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ couldn't risk helping that girl, he would've put us all in danger.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	Where were that girl's friends? Or family? ^CharacterName^ wasn't obliged to save her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	That soldier was so cruel to that girl... And ^CharacterName^ was too powerless to stop him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/01	The military are so cruel... we have to make sure we're able to defend ourselves against them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Poor, defenseless girl, abused by that monster... but if ^CharacterName^ had tried to stop him, we could have all been in danger.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	That unfortunate girl... I can't imagine something like that happen to my sister, daughter, or friend.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	I can understand why ^CharacterName^ did not help that girl. It was too dangerous.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	What could have ^CharacterName^ done against that soldier? They're trained killers!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ saw something horrible happen last night, but I don't know what it was.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I'm angry at ^CharacterName^! Something's wrong but {mr|he}{fr|she} won't share with me what it is...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlRaped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	I know something really bad happened last night, but ^CharacterName^ won't tell me what it was.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Some poor lady was in trouble and ^CharacterName^ came to her aid, but it was really dangerous. {mr|He}{fr|She} could've died!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	An evil soldier wanted to hurt some poor girl, but ^CharacterName^ saved her! I hope that soldier is dead!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestViolator/GirlSaved/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} saved some girl, but {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't tell me all the details even though I asked.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Those snipers are everywhere... I don't want ^CharacterName^ to go out again! I want {mr|him}{fr|her} to be safe!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hope someone kills that sniper! How dare he shoot at ^CharacterName^?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManNotHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	A sniper tried to kill ^CharacterName^! I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to go back there again...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ saved that man risking {mr|his}{fr|her} life. What if {mr|he}{fr|she}'d been killed? What then?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	That man was lucky ^CharacterName^ was there to save him! ^CharacterName^ is the best!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestSniper/ManHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ told me how brave {mr|he}{fr|she} was last night! {mr|He}{fr|She} saved a man shot by a sniper!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ helped some people in the hospital, but who will help us now?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	How can ^CharacterName^ give away our things when we need them? I don't understand!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Helped/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ gave some things to a doctor at the hospital, so that he could save more people who are sick or hurt.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ says a doctor gave {mr|him}{fr|her} some supplies, but I think {mr|he}{fr|she} might have stolen them...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I think ^CharacterName^ might have stolen some things from the hospital but I don't care, as long as {mr|he}{fr|she}'s here with me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestHospital/Stolen/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ got some help from the hospital, but became sad when {mr|he}{fr|she} saw all those poor and hurt people there.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Why are there so many bandits in the city? ^CharacterName^ got rid of some of them, but how many more are left? Will they ever go away?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	No one can beat ^CharacterName^! {mr|He}{fr|She} dealt with a bunch of bandits all by {mr|himself}{fr|herself}. I wish {mr|he}{fr|she} would kill all the bandits and evil soldiers!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/QuestBrothel/Help/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ is a true hero! {mr|He}{fr|She} saved some ladies from some bad men, just like in the stories!

StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Can I have something to eat? Please, I'm hungry...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Why is there nothing to eat? Can't we go out and get something?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I want to eat! Why doesn’t anyone give me something to eat?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	If no one gives me anything to eat, I'm gonna get angry! You'll see!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I'm hungry. I miss hamburgers. And ice cream. And chocolate!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	Can I have a sandwich or something? I'll be good, I promise...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	How come ^CharacterName^ is always hungry?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ is sad because {mr|he}{fr|she} has nothing to eat.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	It's unfair that other people have food when ^CharacterName^ is hungry!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	^CharacterName^ must be really angry that there is no food for {mr|him}{fr|her}. I would be!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ says {mr|he}{fr|she}'s very hungry. Can't {mr|he}{fr|she} go shopping or something?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	I heard ^CharacterName^'s tummy rumbling loudly. I think {mr|he}{fr|she} should eat something.

StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	I'm so hungry it hurts...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	Give me something to eat! I'm hungry!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	If you don't give me something to eat, I'll hate you!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I'm so hungry I'd even eat some dull porridge...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	My tummy hurts, I need to eat something...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	You can see that ^CharacterName^'s tummy hurts...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	If {mr|he}{fr|she} doesn't eat something, ^CharacterName^ will have problems with {mr|his}{fr|her} tummy.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	Maybe some people who have food should share with us? It's not fair if they don't!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	^CharacterName^ says {mr|he}{fr|she}'s very hungry. Why can't we just go buy some food or something?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} is so hungry {mr|he}{fr|she} could eat a horse. But there are no horses here. Not anymore.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	I think ^CharacterName^ should eat something. You have to eat to be healthy.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	^CharacterName^ needs to eat, just look at the poor kid...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I saw a homeless dog once. It was so thin you could see its ribs sticking out. I can see mine now...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	People can die if they don't eat for a long time. Will I die too?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I don't believe that there's nothing to eat!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I want to eat! I want to eat now! My tummy hurts!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	Why does nobody care that I'm hungry? Nobody loves me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	I haven't had anything to eat for a long time, but no one really cares. No one.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	If you look at ^CharacterName^ you can see {mr|his}{fr|her} ribs sticking out...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Will ^CharacterName^ die? {mr|He}{fr|She} looks really bad...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I don't want ^CharacterName^ to die! I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to die!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	We have to get ^CharacterName^ something to eat. We have to!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	I thought I heard a big dog growling last night and it frightened me, but it was only ^CharacterName^'s tummy. {mr|He}{fr|She} should have something to eat.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	^CharacterName^ looks really, really weak. The teachers say that you have to eat meat to be strong. Do we have any?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	I have to get food for ^CharacterName^ at all costs, I can't let this child starve.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I don't want ^CharacterName^ to die! We need a doctor!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ is hurt, what can we do? Let's find some band-aids, or a doctor, or... I... I don't know!

StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	When I grow up, I'll hurt those people who hurt ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ is badly hurt. I wanted to see how badly, but {mr|he}{fr|she} wouldn't let me see.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	^CharacterName^ should get a medal. I heard that soldiers get special medals if they fight and get hurt.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	^CharacterName^ is very badly hurt. I can't stop crying. I'm scared. I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to die!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	How evil do you have to be to hurt a child?! How could they?! Poor little ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	It hurts, it hurts so much, why does it hurt so much?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Can you make it not hurt anymore please? Please...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	When I am older, I'll find the people who hurt me and kill them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	When I grow up, I'll be big and strong, and I'll buy a gun, and I won't let anyone hurt me!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	My wound hurts. It hurts the most when I move or when I touch it, but it even hurts when I don't move. I don't want it to hurt.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	I am hurt. If I were a soldier, I would get a medal. They get medals when they get hurt.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Don't leave me alone at night, I'm scared that those bad people will come again... please...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	I'm scared... I'm scared... I'm scared...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	If I were a soldier, I would kill all the bad people! All of them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	Those bad people deserve to die! I hope the snipers kill them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	I'm scared! I don't want those bad people to come here again. Can you stop them from coming here again?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	Some bad people came here last night! They came to steal our things and hurt us! Why did they do that?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	Poor ^CharacterName^, what have they done to {mr|him}{fr|her}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ShelterAttacked/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/01	If I had stayed with ^CharacterName^, maybe {mr|he}{fr|she} wouldn't have got hurt...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ is dead isn't {mr|he}{fr|she}? Tell me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	No it's not true, it can't be true! ^CharacterName^ can't be dead!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	No, I don't believe it! It's a lie! ^CharacterName^ can't be dead!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	Why is ^CharacterName^ dead?! Why not the people who killed {mr|him}{fr|her}! They should be dead! I want them dead!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	I haven't seen ^CharacterName^ today. Where did {mr|he}{fr|she} go? Will {mr|he}{fr|she} come back?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ did not come back this morning. What happened? Is {mr|he}{fr|she} okay?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	I hate everyone!!! I want my ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	How could ^CharacterName^ die? How? It's not fair...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	No... ^CharacterName^... No...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ have to die? I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	^CharacterName^ can't be dead! What will we do without {mr|him}{fr|her}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Something horrible happened last night. Yesterday ^CharacterName^ wasn't feeling well, and now... now {mr|he}{fr|she}'s dead.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	Why did ^CharacterName^ have to die? I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to be dead!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/HoungryWoundedSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ die? Why?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Why did those bad men kill ^CharacterName^? Why? {mr|He}{fr|She} didn’t do anything to them...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Those evil people will come back and kill us like they killed ^CharacterName^. I just know it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hate those people who killed ^CharacterName^! I hate them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	If I could make those evil people who killed ^CharacterName^ die, I would!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Some bad people came here last night and killed ^CharacterName^! It's unfair! Why did they do that?! Why?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	Last night bandits came and killed ^CharacterName^. I couldn't save {mr|him}{fr|her}. When I grow up, I'll become a dark avenger and avenge {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledDuringAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	I hate everyone!!! I want my ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	It's so cold... so cold... ^CharacterName^ was so cold, {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't wake up...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Will I freeze like ^CharacterName^? Does it hurt to die like that?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I don't want to fall asleep and not wake up like ^CharacterName^, I want it to be warm!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I hate the cold! It took ^CharacterName^, and it wants to take us too! We can't let it!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	It was very cold last night and ^CharacterName^ didn't wake up in the morning. Why can't it be warm? If it was warm, {mr|he}{fr|she} would be okay!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	It's so cold that if you go to sleep you might not wake up, like ^CharacterName^. I don't want to end up cold and pale like {mr|him}{fr|her}. I don't want to!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/Freeze/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	I hate winter! I hate it! I want my ^CharacterName^ back!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ go out during the day? {mr|He}{fr|She} knew how dangerous it was!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	We mustn't go out during the day... we mustn't go out during the day... we mustn't...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	If ^CharacterName^ didn't go with those people, {mr|he}{fr|she}'d still be with us. I hate them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I hate this war! I hate it! Why can't we go out and be safe?! It's not fair, not fair...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	You're not supposed to leave home during the day because it's dangerous, but ^CharacterName^ did and {mr|he}{fr|she} hasn't come back!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	^CharacterName^ went to help our neighbors, but didn't come back. Did something bad happen to {mr|him}{fr|her}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/DwellerDied/KilledOnVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	Don't lie to me! ^CharacterName^ will be back soon, we just have to wait!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I was so worried... I don't want ^CharacterName^ to leave during the day again...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	We're not supposed to go out during the day, I was scared ^CharacterName^ wouldn't come back...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ go out during the day?! {mr|He}{fr|She} could've got hurt or killed!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I'm angry that ^CharacterName^ left when the sun was still up! It was dangerous!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	I'm glad ^CharacterName^ came back, I missed {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ReturnFromVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	^CharacterName^ said that it's dangerous outside and I was worried when {mr|he}{fr|she} was leaving. I'm happy {mr|he}{fr|she} is back!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	We're really, really sick... I hope someone helps us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	This illness is horrible... we need help...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hate being sick! I feel terrible and I'm so weak...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	A doctor... we need to go to see a doctor...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	We are sick. A doctor should come and help us!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	Why doesn't someone help us? We need some pills or something! Someone should go to a pharmacy!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I'm worried, I don't want the grown-ups to be sick... what will I do if they don't get better?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	If the grown-ups don't get better how can they protect me?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	The grown-ups must get better. They must!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	Can't the grown-ups take some pills or something? They can't be sick all the time!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	The others are sick, so it's up to me to be strong! They need my help.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupSick/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	The priest says that if you pray really hard, it will help. I'll pray for the others to get better soon!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	We need something to eat, I think anything will do...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	How come no one is going to get food when we're so hungry?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	There must be something to eat somewhere! Can't we go and get it?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	If I was a wolf or a tiger, I could eat the soldiers! It’s too bad I'm not...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	Everyone is hungry, we should go get some food. Pizza would be great!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	We all need a big dinner, like during the holidays! We would always get stuffed. I miss that.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	The grown-ups complain about how hungry they are. I'd like to help them, but there's nothing I can do...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Why is it so hard to get food? What happened to all the shops? It's all the soldiers' fault, isn't it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	It makes me angry that we can't get anything to eat because of the stupid soldiers!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I hope the soldiers are hungry too! I hope they have nothing to eat either and will go away soon!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	The adults complain that they are hungry... If I was like Allan Quatermain, I could hunt wild animals and we could eat them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/Starving/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	I wish we had the magical horn of plenty. No one would go hungry then! But where could we find it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	If only we could fly out of the city... We'd never be hungry again! It’s too bad we can't...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	The pain in my tummy is really bad... I have to eat something... anything...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	If I was bigger and stronger, I would get food for all of us. I hate that I'm so small!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	We could take some guns or axes or clubs and take food from someone else, couldn't we?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I'm so hungry I could cry, but we have no food. Someone should share with us, why don't they?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	I heard somewhere that hungry, shipwrecked people sometimes eat each other! Yuck, that's gross! I don't want to eat anyone! And I hope no one will eat me, I don't want to be eaten!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I can't believe that there's not enough food for everyone, how's it possible?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Is there really so little food left? What happened to all the supermarkets and restaurants?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	Wolves kill to get food, maybe we should do the same?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	We must get something to eat! If you don't eat at all you will die!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	My friend once said that hungry, shipwrecked people sometimes eat each other! Yuck, that's so gross! I don't think anyone would want to eat me, would they?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/ExtremeStarvation/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	If I had a magic lamp with a genie inside, I'd wish for us to have lots of food!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Why can't I get anything to eat? I was good...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Everyone is very hungry... it's so weird, why isn't there enough food?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I'm hungry! If I don't get something to eat, I'll get angry!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	There must be something to eat somewhere, you just have to try harder to get it!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I'd love some burgers! We should all go to a burger house! Why don't we?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	Last time I was this hungry was when there was only disgusting porridge to eat, and I didn't eat it, and I didn't get anything else for a whole day as punishment.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Why is everyone hungry? Is there really no food left?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	I remember seeing a hungry, homeless dog once. It had such sad eyes... I don't want anyone to have such sad eyes.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I don't understand why the grown-ups can’t get more food. It shouldn't be that hard!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	One of my teachers said if you really want something from life, you can have it. But it was a lie. If it were true, we would have a lot of food.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	If you are hungry, why don't you order some food? I know phones don't work, but you could go and order some takeaway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupHungry/VeryHungry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	The priest says that God gave food to some hungry people in the desert, so he will give us food if we pray to him, right?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	We are hurt, we should be in hospital...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Why doesn't anyone protect us? Where are the police? Don't they know that we're helpless?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I want the people who hurt us dead! If I could, I'd kill them all!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I hope someone kills the people who hurt us! I hate them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	Why do bad people hurt us?! What did we do to them? I know I didn't do anything!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	Why are there so many bad people around? Why don't the police put them in jail? We should tell the police about the bad people that hurt us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	If I wasn't so small I wouldn't let anyone hurt us...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	If only a superhero would come to protect us from the criminals...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hate people who hurt others! I hope they burn in hell!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	People who hurt others don't deserve to live! I hope the bombs kill them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	When I am big and strong I will punish people who hurt you! They'll get what they deserve!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/GroupWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	If I was a superhero I wouldn't let anyone hurt you! I'll become a superhero when I grow up, just wait and see!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ did something horrible. But I don’t know what it was.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	There was blood on ^CharacterName^'s hands when {mr|he}{fr|she} came home...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hate this war! It made ^CharacterName^ do something really bad.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I hate it when ^CharacterName^ goes out at night, I wish {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't have to! Bad things happen out there!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	I know something really bad must've happened to ^CharacterName^. {mr|He}{fr|She} doesn't look well. Just look at {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ManyCharactersKilled/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	No one will tell me what happened last night to ^CharacterName^. They should tell me, I'm not a kid anymore!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	A nice man came to us and gave us some pills. Was he a doctor?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/MedsForAnna/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Some man came to us. He seemed nice, but I think he was a drug dealer.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	A man was shot and ^CharacterName^ went to save him! {mr|He}{fr|She}'s a hero!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	A man came to us and he said his brother was shot and he needed help. But I think it was a trap.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/OneShot/WoundedBrother/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	I'm not supposed to be alone for long, so no one went with the man who asked us for help.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ went to visit those nice neighbors who gave us vegetables. Maybe this time they will give us fruit or candy?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those nice neighbors came to us again. I was hoping they brought us some fruit or candy, but they didn't.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp2/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those nice neighbors who brought us vegetables came again, and asked for some help, but ^CharacterName^ couldn't leave me here alone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	That nice lady who visited us before asked ^CharacterName^ for help with something, and {mr|he}{fr|she} went with her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	That nice lady who visited us before asked ^CharacterName^ for help with something, but {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't go with her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeighbourlyHelp/NeighbourlyHelp3N/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	The nice lady came to us but there was no grown-up at home and she didn't say what she wanted.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Some kids came to visit us! We gave them some pills for their mom. I wonder if I can play with them the next time they come.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Some kids came to visit us. They looked really sad, I hope they are okay.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Some kids came to us asking for some pills for their mom, but we didn't have any. I hope their mom gets better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those kids came again, but they didn't want to play, they asked for food. We gave them some.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those kids came again, but they didn't want to play, they asked for food. We didn't give them any.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2Y/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those kids came again, but they didn't want to play, they asked for food. We had no food to give them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those kids came again, crying for help! ^CharacterName^ went to take their mom to hospital.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those kids came again crying for help, but no one went to help them. I would go, but I'm too small.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedMeds/NeedMeds2N/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those kids came again crying for help, but there was no grown-up at home apart from ^CharacterName^, and {mr|he}{fr|she} had to stay with me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ went to help some people from a house that was hit by a bomb. {mr|He}{fr|She} has a good heart.

StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/CollapsedHouse/CollapsedHouse3Y/no/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	A pretty lady came to us to say 'thank you' for helping her dad. It was very nice of her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ went to help our neighbor. I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} brings some good things. Maybe even chocolate?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	If ^CharacterName^ went with our neighbor, maybe he would give us some good things. Maybe even chocolate...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ went to the hospital for some medicine. {mr|He}{fr|She} says it will help us a lot.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/HelpSteal/HelpSteal3Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	No one went with our neighbor to the hospital because he isn't a good man.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Two rebels came and gave us some food! Maybe they're not that bad after all?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/AidContainer/AidContainer2/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	Those rebel soldiers were really scary, but they didn't hurt us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	A lady came to us. She looked really worried so ^CharacterName^ went with her to help her solve her problem.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	A lady came to us. She looked really worried, but no one did anything to help. I wonder why?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection1/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	A lady in distress came, but I didn't want to stay alone and ^CharacterName^ didn't go with her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/Yes/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	The same lady as before came, and this time she looked really, really scared, so ^CharacterName^ went with her to make her feel safe.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/No/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	The same lady as before came, and this time she looked really, really scared, but we were scared too, and we didn't go to help her.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Visits/NodeVisits/NeedProtection/NeedProtection2Y/CantHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	The same lady as before came, and this time she looked really, really scared, but ^CharacterName^ didn't want to leave me here alone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^... No... No...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Why, ^CharacterName^... Why...?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hate ^CharacterName^ for leaving me! I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I don't believe ^CharacterName^ killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}! It's a lie! Someone must've killed {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	No! It's horrible! ^CharacterName^ killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}! Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} do that?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Suicide/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	^CharacterName^ can't be dead! {mr|He}{fr|She} can't!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	That's impossible... ^CharacterName^ wouldn't run away with all our things, would {mr|he}{fr|she}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	I don't believe ^CharacterName^ wanted to steal our things, someone must've made {mr|him}{fr|her} to do it!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hate ^CharacterName^! I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} gets caught by soldiers!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I hope someone hurts ^CharacterName^! Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} steal from us?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ ran away with all our things! I didn't know {mr|he}{fr|she} was a thief! I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} dies!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftAndRobbedShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	How could ^CharacterName^ steal all of our things? I thought {mr|he}{fr|she} was our friend!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ wouldn’t have left us, {mr|he}{fr|she} must've been kidnapped!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	Why did ^CharacterName^ leave us? I don't understand...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	^CharacterName^ shouldn't have left us like that. I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} regrets it!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	^CharacterName^ is a stupid coward. {mr|He}{fr|She} was afraid to stay here with us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	I'm sure ^CharacterName^ left us to bring some help. We just have to wait.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/LeftShelter/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	I believe ^CharacterName^ will come back to us. {mr|He}{fr|She} surely will.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Poor ^CharacterName^... {mr|He}{fr|She} couldn't stand staying here any longer.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	If no one shared anything with me, I'd run away like ^CharacterName^!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	We were really selfish and stupid, and we made ^CharacterName^ run away.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	Where is ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} should be here to help us fight the bandits if they come at night!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	I think ^CharacterName^ ran away, because everyone was mean to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/RunAway/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	You didn't share with ^CharacterName^, and look what you did! {mr|He}{fr|She} ran away!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	No one wants to share with ^CharacterName^, that's really mean...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} will leave us if we don't treat {mr|him}{fr|her} better.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I would be angry just like ^CharacterName^ if people were so mean to me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	We shouldn't make ^CharacterName^ angry. I read about a superhero who becomes very dangerous when he gets angry.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ is angry, because everyone is mean to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DwellerAngry/Angry/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	No one likes to be bullied! Why is everyone mean to ^CharacterName^?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Cry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I cried myself to sleep, but no one came to hug me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Cry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	I don't want to cry, but I just can't help it...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Cry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hate crying, but sometimes I just can't help it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Cry/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I'm really unhappy and I don't know what to do and I hate it and tears just keep flowing, even though I try to hold them back.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Cry/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	Last night I was really scared of the noises outside... I cried and I couldn't sleep.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Cry/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	I couldn't sleep, something was under my bed, and I was so scared! I cried, but no one came to help me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Cry/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	My little ^CharacterName^ woke up crying and I couldn't calm {mr|him}{fr|her} down. It was heart-breaking and I felt so helpless... I just hope {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be able to sleep calmly when all this is over.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Affray/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	The grown-ups were arguing last night... I think it may be my fault...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Affray/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	I don't want the grown-ups to argue, I'm scared when they scream and shout at each other...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Affray/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I hate it when the grown-ups argue! Why can't they be nice to each other?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Affray/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	Can't the grown-ups see it's stupid to argue when we have so many other problems?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Affray/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	The adults were arguing at night. They were shouting and I couldn't sleep. I hope they weren't angry because of me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Affray/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	I don't like it when the adults argue and shout. I'm always worried they are angry because of me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Fight/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ acted like a bully last night... I was scared {mr|he}{fr|she} would hit me too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Fight/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	I tried to stop ^CharacterName^ from being a bully, but {mr|he}{fr|she} wouldn't listen...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Fight/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	The grown-ups should be fighting the bandits, not each other! Can't they see it?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Fight/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	Fighting each other is stupid, when soldiers and bandits want to kill us!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Fight/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	The adults got into a fight last night, I couldn't stop them, I was so scared!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/Fight/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	Something was wrong last night, the adults were shouting angrily so I covered my head with a blanket. I don't know what happened, I just hope it wasn't my fault.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DrunkTrauma/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	Does ^CharacterName^ have to drink alcohol? I'm scared of {mr|him}{fr|her} when {mr|he}{fr|she} does...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DrunkTrauma/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	I don't want ^CharacterName^ to drink alcohol... It makes {mr|him}{fr|her} act weird...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DrunkTrauma/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	Drinking alcohol is bad! Why does ^CharacterName^ drink? I hate it when {mr|he}{fr|she} does!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DrunkTrauma/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I wish ^CharacterName^ didn't drink! It's stupid! We could sell alcohol and buy food instead!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DrunkTrauma/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	^CharacterName^ drank alcohol last night, {mr|he}{fr|she} was shouting, and I was scared {mr|he}{fr|she} would hurt me, so I hid in a wardrobe.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/DrunkTrauma/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	Alcohol made ^CharacterName^ act very weird last night. I did not want {mr|him}{fr|her} to see me, so I hid and waited until {mr|he}{fr|she} went to sleep.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I thought everyone had forgotten about me. ^CharacterName^ didn't, but I'm still sad...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/01	^CharacterName^ talked to me last night and helped me, but I still feel unloved...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	How could everyone forget about my needs and only remember at night?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/01	I needed help all day, but only got it at night... I hate it when I'm ignored!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I felt terrible at night but ^CharacterName^ came to help me!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	^CharacterName^ was very kind to me, when I thought I'd be ignored.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/00	I just couldn't leave ^CharacterName^ suffering like that...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/01	Why didn't I help ^CharacterName^ sooner? What was I thinking!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Homie/00	Poor kid, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll get better now that I helped.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Homie/01	Who are we if we let our youngest suffer? How would I be able to look at myself in the mirror if I hadn't helped ^CharacterName^?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/00	I know we're short on supplies, but I just couldn't listen to ^CharacterName^ crying, it was heart-breaking.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/01	I just had to help ^CharacterName^. I know everyone would've done the same, despite our shortage of supplies.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Egoist/00	I just couldn't stand that annoying kid's whining anymore. It was better to give {mr|him}{fr|her} what {mr|he}{fr|she} wanted.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/HERO_LOG/Egoist/01	Kids have ways of messing with your head, which is why I helped ^CharacterName^ even if it didn’t seem sensible.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Damn it! We're saving supplies for a rainy day and someone wastes them on that useless kid!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	Bloody hell! How are we meant to save up anything if ^CharacterName^ gets whatever {mr|he}{fr|she} as soon as {mr|he}{fr|she} starts crying?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Helping ^CharacterName^ was a decent thing to do, but I'm a little worried about our supplies...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	I understand ^CharacterName^ needed help, but our supplies are dwindling. We should be saving them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Poor ^CharacterName^ I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} will get better now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	I wish we had enough supplies for everyone, but I agree that ^CharacterName^ should get them first.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	We have to stick together and look after our own. Sharing with ^CharacterName^ first, was the only right thing to do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildHelp/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	Kids are the most vulnerable, we have to protect them at all costs. They should be the first to get food and meds.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	It was foolish of ^OtherCharacterName^ to take ^CharacterName^ and leave. No one else will help them.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/01	How could ^OtherCharacterName^ take ^CharacterName^ and just disappear, without saying a word? They're taking a huge risk.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Why did they leave? We were better off together, weren't we?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	I wonder where did ^OtherCharacterName^ take ^CharacterName^? They should've stayed here.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	^OtherCharacterName^ took ^CharacterName^ and left? Fuck them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/01	So ^OtherCharacterName^ and that annoying kid are gone? Very well, I don't fucking need them!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	They left? Good. I'm better off without that useless kid anyway.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/01	^OtherCharacterName^ rid me of that annoying kid? Finally.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm worried about ^CharacterName^ and ^OtherCharacterName^. I hope they're okay.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/01	^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best to take ^CharacterName^ and leave. I blame myself for not trying harder to make them stay.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I wonder if ^CharacterName^ is safer with ^OtherCharacterName^ than here. I hope so, for their sake.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildLeft/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	Are ^OtherCharacterName^ and ^CharacterName^ better off on their own? Sadly, I doubt it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	The poor kid has nightmares already... {mr|He}{fr|She}'ll probably have trouble sleeping even after the war is over.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ had a terrible nightmare and wouldn't go back to sleep for a long time. I wish I knew how to help {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ already has terrible nightmares. There's a high chance {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be scarred for the rest of {mr|his}{fr|her} life.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ had a terrible nightmare and stayed awake for some time afterwards. This might mess with {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep cycle.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ has terrible nightmares, and there's nothing I can do to help...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	Poor kid, will these nightmares never cease to haunt {mr|him}{fr|her}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ had a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I should keep watch over {mr|him}{fr|her} the next time.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	If that annoying kid doesn't stop being noisy at night, I'm gonna get seriously mad.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	Everyone has a bad dream once in a while, what's all the fuss?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ had a nightmare and just wouldn't go back to sleep, keeping me awake for hours.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	This bloody war gives little ^CharacterName^ nightmares! {mr|He}{fr|She} wakes up screaming or crying! I wish there was something I could do to help...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/HERO_LOG/Kid/Apathic/00	I had a horrible dream! I don't want to go to sleep, I don't want to have this dream again!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/HERO_LOG/Kid/Aggressive/00	I had a dream that I was all alone, hungry and cold, and everyone else was dead... I'm afraid to close my eyes now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I had a horrible dream... The soldiers were killing everyone, I tried to run away but they chased me, they wanted to kill me too... They caught me and I woke up. I don't want to have this dream ever again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Nightmares/HERO_LOG/Kid/01	I had a horrible dream... The soldiers were killing everyone, I tried to run away but they chased me, they wanted to kill me too... They caught me and I woke up. I don't want to have this dream ever again.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Poor ^CharacterName^ had some kind of panic attack, and it pains me that I didn't know what I could do to help...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Poor ^CharacterName^ woke up screaming and had some kind of panic attack. There just was no calming {mr|him}{fr|her} down.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ panic attacks might have serious consequences. Is there anything we can do about them?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ woke up screaming and had a panic attack. I wonder if leaving the light on could help {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	It's so unfair that kids like ^CharacterName^ have to suffer from insecurity and panic attacks.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ should have a happy childhood, but instead {mr|he}{fr|she} is so frightened {mr|he}{fr|she} wakes up screaming at night...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Poor ^CharacterName^ woke up screaming and had some kind of panic attack. It took all night to calm {mr|him}{fr|her} down.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	How can we get any rest at night, if that kid keeps screaming?!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ was screaming at night, as if it wasn't bad enough.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ started screaming in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. What's wrong with this kid?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/PanicAttack/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	My poor ^CharacterName^ was panicking at night... Is there anything I can do to ease {mr|his}{fr|her} mind?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^'s obsession with fire is disturbing... Are such things permanent or can they be cured? I wish I'd read about it when I had the chance.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm really worried about ^CharacterName^. Last night {mr|he}{fr||she} started a fire, fortunately it was noticed before it could spread. {mr|He}{fr||She} wouldn't say why {mr|he}{fr||she} did this.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ should be closely watched, else {mr|he}{fr||she} might burn the house down!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	This is worrying! Last night ^CharacterName^ started a fire, which was fortunately noticed before it could spread. I think I'd better keep an eye on {mr|him}{fr||her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	I'm worried about ^CharacterName^, our difficult situation is taking a heavy toll on {mr|his}{fr|her} fragile mind.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	I wish there was a way to protect ^CharacterName^ from all the horror and destruction that surrounds us.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Oh, poor ^CharacterName^. This situation bears so heavily on {mr|him}{fr||her} that last night {mr|he}{fr||she} started a fire! Fortunately it didn't spread.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	What the fuck? That blasted kid almost burned our house! What's wrong with {mr|him}{fr|her}?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	What's this kid's problem? Aren't we in deep enough shit already? Does {mr|he}{fr|she} have to make it even worse?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	What a night! ^CharacterName^ has started a fire which was thankfully put out before it could spread. {mr|He}{fr||She}'s becoming a danger!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/FireStart/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	I hope I can cure ^CharacterName^ of this absurd fascination with fire. Perhaps I should devote more time to playing and talking with {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ is becoming a really angry kid. I hope it doesn't get worse...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ had a fit of rage in the evening, screaming and kicking things, and refused to go to bed. It was impossible to calm {mr|him}{fr|her} down until midnight.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	Damn it... Trying to get some rest while having to deal with an angry kid is nigh-on impossible.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ threw a tantrum in the evening, screaming and kicking things, and refused to go to bed. {mr|He}{fr||She} finally collapsed around midnight, exhausted.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ has anger management problems. I fear about {mr|his}{fr|her} future.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ is becoming violent. There's a risk that {mr|he}{fr|she} might remain so in the future.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Poor ^CharacterName^ had a fit of rage in the evening, screaming and kicking things, and refused to go to bed. Calming {mr|him}{fr|her} down took a lot of time, almost until midnight.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	If that kid doesn't calm down, I'll show {mr|him}{fr|her} what angry really means.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^'s anger management problems are not my concern, as long as I can get a decent sleep.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	CharacterName^ was acting up all evening. {mr|He}{fr|She} screamed, kicked things and refused to go to bed until midnight.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Anger/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	I'm worried ^CharacterName^ is becoming violent. I hope it passes when the war is over.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	The poor kid doesn't get enough attention, but how can {mr|he}{fr|she}, when there are so many other important problems to deal with.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ acted distraught, asked for water, complained about the cold and kept it up all night. {mr|He}{fr|She} probably needs more attention.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	Oh for crying out loud, doesn't ^CharacterName^ realize there's a war going on? Isn't {mr|he}{fr|she}'s big enough to last a night without pampering?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ acted distraught, asked for water, complained about the cold and kept it up all night. I guess {mr|he}{fr|she} just wants more attention.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	It's really sad that we can't devote enough time to play and talk with ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Insensitive/00	I wish it was possible to spend more time with ^CharacterName^, but let's be honest, there are more important things on my mind right now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	^CharacterName^ was inconsolable tonight, asking for water, complaining of cold and loneliness. {mr|He}{fr|She} desperately needs company.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	"I want this, I want that, bring me something, hug me..." ^CharacterName^ should quit whining, we all have it tough right now.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ wants more attention? Why don't we just drop whatever we're doing and serve the little {mr|prince}{fr|princess}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ was unbearable all night, constantly asking for things, complaining and generally demanding attention.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/AttentionDemand/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	^CharacterName^ really needs a lot of attention now. I should make as much time as possible to play and talk with {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Poor ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} must be really ashamed of what happened at night...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Poor ^CharacterName^ wet the bed in {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep. {mr|He}{fr|She} was understandably upset over this - {mr|he}{fr|she}'s a big {mr|boy}{fr|girl} after all.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ is just scared, it will pass. What worries me is the fact that we'll have to change and wash the sheets more often than we'd like.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	^CharacterName^ wet the bed in {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep. It'll be difficult to keep the clothes and sheets dry, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} doesn't catch a cold!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	Something's clearly wrong with ^CharacterName^, fear and stress are taking their toll on {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Poor ^CharacterName^ wet the bed in {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep. It took {mr|him}{fr|her} a while to accept that this happens to adults as well under such stress and there's nothing to be ashamed about.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	Fuck it! I sure ain't sleeping in the same bed as that pissing brat.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	If the kid can't control {mr|himself}{fr|herself}, {mr|he}{fr|she} should sleep on the floor.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ wet the bed in {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep. {mr|He}{fr|She}'s a big {mr|boy}{fr|girl}, accidents like that shouldn't happen to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/WetBed/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	Something's wrong with ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} is old enough not to pee in bed. This shouldn't have happened!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	It was really disturbing to see a child playing like that...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	Last night ^CharacterName^ played with {mr|his}{fr|her} toys in a way I wish I could forget. First {mr|he}{fr|she} was separating "men" from "women", then executing them. Poor kid...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	I hope those responsible for war crimes get punished after the fighting's done. Regardless, children will remember.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	Last night ^CharacterName^ played with {mr|his}{fr|her} toys, separating "men" from "women", then executing them. Kids include whatever they see in their play, so I guess that's "normal"... A new normal.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	That game ^CharacterName^ was playing... Children should never witness such things...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	Last night ^CharacterName^ played with {mr|his}{fr|her} toys, separating "men" from "women", then executing them. What this war inflicts on children can never be undone.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Aggressive/00	The atrocities that both sides have committed are reflected in our children's behavior...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	I don't care what ^CharacterName^ plays, as long as {mr|he}{fr|she} remains quiet.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Last night ^CharacterName^ performed a mock execution using {mr|his}{fr|her} toys. This is messed up, kids shouldn't behave like that!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Reenactment/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	Why did ^CharacterName^ have to see such atrocities? How can people do that to other people?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ is clearly becoming catatonic. I'd like to help, but I don't know how.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	I'm really worried. ^CharacterName^ shut down completely yesterday evening, didn't react to anything, just sat on the floor rocking back and forth. I didn't know what to do.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	When all this is over, we should get a psychologist to help ^CharacterName^. But for now there are more important problems than that.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	This is serious. ^CharacterName^ became catatonic this evening, just sat on the floor rocking back and forth and didn't react to anything. There must be a way to help {mr|him}{fr|her}!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	Poor kid, {mr|his}{fr|her} fragile mind is breaking under pressure.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I'm beside myself with worry. ^CharacterName^ has shut down completely this evening, didn't react to anything, just sat on the floor rocking back and forth. This war can't end soon enough.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	It looks really creepy when ^CharacterName^ is rocking back and forth, but at least {mr|he}{fr|she} is quiet.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	Tonight ^CharacterName^ acted really weird, just sat on the floor rocking back and forth and didn't answer. I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} gets better, it was unnerving like hell.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Catationia/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	I have to help ^CharacterName^, but how do you deal with catatonia?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/ImaginaryFriend/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ misses {mr|his}{fr|her} friends so much that {mr|he}{fr|she} invented an imaginary one.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/ImaginaryFriend/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	^CharacterName^ was talking to someone at night, but when I went to check, there was no one there. It looks that {mr|he}{fr|she} has an imaginary friend! I kinda wish I could have such an escape myself.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/ImaginaryFriend/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ seems to have invented an imaginary friend. Well, if that helps {mr|him}{fr|her} cope with reality...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/ImaginaryFriend/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	I was alarmed when I heard the voice of ^CharacterName^ talking to someone last night, but to my relief there was no one there – it seems {mr|he}{fr|she} just has an imaginary friend. We could all use one...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/ImaginaryFriend/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	^CharacterName^ must be very lonely, but this imaginary friend thing is a bit disturbing.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/ImaginaryFriend/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	When I went to check on ^CharacterName^ last night, I found {mr|him}{fr|her} talking to {mr|him}{fr|her}self. Looks like {mr|he}{fr|she} has an imaginary friend! I hope it gives {mr|him}{fr|her} some relief.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/ImaginaryFriend/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ was talking to an empty room last night. Looks like {mr|he}{fr|she} has an imaginary friend! At least {mr|he}{fr|she} isn't bothering me.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/ImaginaryFriend/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	^CharacterName^ must be really lonely to have invented an imaginary friend, I'm worried about {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/Apathic/00	Last night, ^CharacterName^ was so scared that {mr|he}{fr|she} hid in a wardrobe. Poor kid.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/00	When bedtime came, ^CharacterName^ was nowhere to be found. After hours of searching, {mr|he}{fr|she} was found asleep, hidden in a wardrobe. What a relief.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/Insensitive/00	There's only trouble with that kid. Wasting our time hiding like that. What'll {mr|he}{fr|she} think of next?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/00	It was difficult to find ^CharacterName^ when {mr|he}{fr|she} was hiding last night. At least now I know where to look for {mr|him}{fr|her} next time.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/Apathic/00	It pains me to see ^CharacterName^ so scared. Children should feel safe and loved.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/00	I was worried about ^CharacterName^. I'm glad we found {mr|him}{fr|her} hidden in a wardrobe. I hope that at least {mr|he}{fr|she} felt safe for a while.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/Insensitive/00	^CharacterName^ can sleep in that wardrobe every night for all I care.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/Egoist/00	^CharacterName^ disappeared this evening, causing a frantic search through all the rooms, only to be found hidden in a wardrobe, asleep. What got into that kid!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/Trauma/ChildOnly/Hiding/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	I was frightened when I couldn't find ^CharacterName^. It was such a relief to find {mr|him}{fr|her}.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ChildNewHome/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	Our new home has broken windows and there are big holes in the walls. I'm sometimes cold, but I have a place out of the rain for my things!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ChildAlone/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	There was no one home at night. I was all alone! I was really scared...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ChildOverWorked/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	All I do is work and work. It's too much! I'm tired!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ChildOverWorked/SPEC_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	I think ^CharacterName^ is working too hard for a kid, {mr|he}{fr|she} deserves a break.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EndOfMourning/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I don't care what happens now. I miss my ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ProtectorBroken/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	^CharacterName^ worries so much that it makes {mr|him}{fr|her} ill. I'm very sad too.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ProtectorBroken/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	My poor ^CharacterName^, my heart breaks when {mr|he}{fr|she}'s crying. War is especially hard on children...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WinterStart/HERO_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	It's snowing!!! I want to build a snowman and have a snowball fight, but my friends aren't here, and it's very cold, even inside when the fire goes out.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WinterStart/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	It's snowing!!! I want to build a snowman and have a snowball fight, but my friends aren't here, and it's very cold, even inside when the fire goes out.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ChildWellFed/HERO_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	I ate so much I thought I'd burst. It feels so good not to have to go to bed hungry!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ChildWellFed/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	I ate so much I thought I'd burst. It feels so good not to have to go to bed hungry!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ChildLonely/HERO_LOG/Kid/00	Why does no one want to play with me? Did I do something wrong?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/ChildWounded/SPECTATOR_LOG/PROTECTORPERSPECTIVE/00	How evil do you have to be to hurt a child?! How could they?! Poor little ^CharacterName^.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/LateFromScavenge/SPECTATOR_LOG/KIDPERSPECTIVE/00	Where's ^CharacterName^? Why didn't {mr|he}{fr|she} come back? Is {mr|he}{fr|she} ok?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/VisitSucceeded/DwellerVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/00	We invited a new person to live at our home. I'll have someone new to talk and play with!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/VisitSucceeded/DwellerVisit/SPECTATOR_LOG/Kid/01	Someone will come and stay with us for some time. I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} is nice.
StateSpeeches/Comfort/ChildTexts/OneDweller/A	Knowing that the child is happy lifts my spirits.
StateSpeeches/Comfort/ChildTexts/OneDweller/B	It could be better, but at least the child is doing okay.
StateSpeeches/Comfort/ChildTexts/OneDweller/C	It's good to have a child around, but heartbreaking to see it unhappy.

CharacterBios/Iskra/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I don't really like this place, but it's better than our basement. It was dark and damp in there. And there were rats living there. I hope there are no rats here. I'm afraid of rats. They are icky, they climb over you when you are asleep, and they can bite you!
CharacterBios/Iskra/Story_Step_1/Trauma	I hate this place! It has a basement and rats live in basements! I hate rats! They are icky, they climb over you when you are asleep, and they can bite you! I don't want to stay here, I want to go home.
CharacterBios/Iskra/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	In our basement, there lived this one large rat, the biggest rat ever. Every night he would come out of a hole in the wall, try to snatch some of our food, and scuttle back in. I knew I had to try to stop him.
CharacterBios/Iskra/Story_Step_2/Trauma	In our basement there lived a horrible, ugly rat. It was really scary, and every night it would crawl out of its hole and steal some of our food. I would freeze every time I saw it. I knew I had to do something, but I was so scared.
CharacterBios/Iskra/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	The soldiers stopped everyone from coming into the city, so I asked my friend, who had some toy soldiers to help me stop the rat from coming into our basement. He agreed and we put them on guard in front of the rat-hole. But when night came, the rat just trampled on them. So next time, we placed the soldiers behind a barricade made of bricks and rubble.
CharacterBios/Iskra/Story_Step_3/Trauma	Dad was always busy, he said we had more serious problems than rats, he did nothing to help. My friend said that the soldiers stopped everyone from coming into the city, so maybe toy soldiers would stop a rat? We tried putting them in front of the rat-hole, but the rat just trampled on them. We had to do something bigger, so we blocked the hole with bricks and rubble.
CharacterBios/Iskra/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	Our anti-rat barricade worked! That night the rat retreated! We were victorious! I was so happy about it that I decided to share my last bit of chocolate that I had been saving for my birthday. The next day the soldiers came and we had to leave our basement and look for another place to live. I don't know what happened to that rat.
CharacterBios/Iskra/Story_Step_4/Trauma	Our anti-rat barricade worked at first, but the following night the rat broke through it. Rats are unstoppable. What was worse was that it stole the last bit of chocolate that I was saving for my birthday. I felt so miserable. The next day the soldiers came and told us to get out. They didn't even give us time to take our things. I hope that rat eats them!
CharacterBios/Iskra/EndLog/Good	After the ceasefire came into effect, the whole family reunited. Despite the harsh reality of war, Iskra managed to remain unscarred. She resumed school. When she went to college, she started writing stories for children as a pastime, and became quite popular. Her new best friend, a fat cat that she named "Mr. Whiskers", helped her get rid of her fear of rats.
CharacterBios/Iskra/EndLog/Mixed	The family managed to reunite after the ceasefire, but Iskra's experiences did not leave her unscarred. Due to her time in the basement, she developed a phobia of rats and confined spaces. Her mother made sure she had a bright room with a large window, and gave her a cat. Iskra always kept him close at night in case any rats came.
CharacterBios/Iskra/EndLog/Bad	Iskra and her mother cried for hours when they were finally reunited. Both of them had horrible memories, which they chose not to talk about. The happy gleam was gone from Iskra's eyes for years to come. She became terribly frightened of rats and confined spaces. She cannot sleep with the lights out. Even long after the war, she sometimes wakes up screaming at night.
CharacterBios/Iskra/EndLog/DwellerDied	ISKRA DIED ENDLOG DEBUG TEXT
CharacterBios/Iskra/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Remember the little girl with the sad eyes, the one that turned up at our door with her father one day? Here's hoping she's alright. With her father protecting her, she must be, right?
CharacterBios/Iskra/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	When morning light came, Iskra was nowhere to be found. Where did she go? Did she set out to find some help?
CharacterBios/Iskra/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
CharacterBios/Iskra/Bio	Hello, my name is Iskra. My mum is visiting my grandma, so dad looks after me now. We will meet again when the soldiers go away. Dad says that they will go away when other countries send us help. I hope it's soon. I miss mum. I miss my friends. I miss my room, TV and ice cream. Did you know we had to live in the basement? Dad said it was safer like that. Can I look around here?
CharacterBios/Ivano/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I would play war games with my friends. We would form two teams and run around with our plastic guns and pretend to shoot each other. If you didn't have a gun, a stick would do. One day we had this great idea, you wanna hear about it?
CharacterBios/Ivano/Story_Step_1/Trauma	Dad said I was too young to fight. I was angry, I cried, but he did not change his mind. So he went to fight, and me and my friends would pretend we were brave rebels defending the city against the evil empire that wanted to destroy it.
CharacterBios/Ivano/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	With rubble and sand we built a barricade in our front yard. We found an old pipe, and we put it on our barricade and pretended it was a cannon. We would pretend to fight off the soldiers, and shoot our cannon at them.
CharacterBios/Ivano/Story_Step_2/Trauma	We had our plastic guns, but no tanks and no cannons or planes, so with piles of rubble we built a barricade in our front yard. We put a big broken pipe on it and pretended it was a cannon. We knew we would die fighting the enemy.
CharacterBios/Ivano/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	We had great fun, until one morning our barricade and our house got bombarded and some people were hurt. Grandpa was very angry with me, he said the soldiers must have thought that our barricade and our cannon were real and they fired their own cannons at us.
CharacterBios/Ivano/Story_Step_3/Trauma	One morning we were holding our barricade, when grandpa called me inside for breakfast. I was eating my oats when there was a great boom! And another one and one more! Our house and yard and barricade were hit by bombs! I wanted to run to my friends, but grandpa held me tight, and didn't let me!
CharacterBios/Ivano/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	Grandpa said we needed to find another place to stay, so we went looking for a nice place, and we came here. When I grow up I won't need a house at all. I will live in a tent like my dad, and fight the bad soldiers like he does.
CharacterBios/Ivano/Story_Step_4/Trauma	After the bombing, we had to leave the house and look for some other place to live. When we were leaving, I saw that my friends' graves were in the place where our barricade used to be. One day, I'll grow big and strong, and I will kill all the bad soldiers for what they did!
CharacterBios/Ivano/EndLog/Good	Henrik did his best to alleviate the effects that the war had on Ivano. He paid for professional psychological help and sent him to a good school. Ivano found a way to express himself through street art, and became quite famous. Once a year he lights a candle for his father by the Unknown Soldiers' memorial in Pogoren.
CharacterBios/Ivano/EndLog/Mixed	Ivano never saw his father again, but always imagined him as a war hero. As a teenager, Ivano joined a nationalist paramilitary group, dreaming of the Independent Republic of Vysena that his father had fought and died for. When the time comes, he will be ready to pick up arms.
CharacterBios/Ivano/EndLog/Bad	His war experiences caused Ivano to become very aggressive, particularly towards the Grazni. Convinced that violence is the right way to solve all problems, he had difficulties adjusting to school life and ended up in a reformatory school. Eventually he joined an extremist terrorist group.
CharacterBios/Ivano/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Henrik and Ivano were unfortunate, but what could we have done? An old man and a kid - two more mouths to feed, with little or no use to us.
CharacterBios/Ivano/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	We have not seen Ivano since the night he left the shelter. Did he go looking for his father? If so, let's hope he found him.
CharacterBios/Ivano/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
CharacterBios/Ivano/Bio	My dad is fighting the bad soldiers. He is brave and won't let them into the city. He said I am too young to fight, but when I grow up I will be just like him. But don't tell grandpa, he doesn't like soldiers. Hey, do you know how to play war games?
CharacterBios/Kalina/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I love mommy and daddy very much. Mommy sings, and brushes my hair, and daddy reads me bedtime stories, and takes me horse riding. I really miss them both, but I understand why they have to be away.
CharacterBios/Kalina/Story_Step_1/Trauma	I miss mommy and daddy a lot. My hair is dirty and not brushed, and no one reads me bedtime stories or takes me horse riding. I don’t understand why they have to be away, I need them!
CharacterBios/Kalina/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	Those people are fighting now, and this is all very sad, so mommy and daddy went to heaven to ask the angels to make them stop. It’s important, so we must stay here with you or with our uncle until they come back… and they promised that we would go to Africa and that it would be great!
CharacterBios/Kalina/Story_Step_2/Trauma	There are so many bad people everywhere now. Bad people want to hurt you. If mommy and daddy were here, nobody would hurt us. But they’re not. They can’t protect us. Grozdan says they are happy now, but how can they be happy without us? I want them back, I want them to take us to Africa, like they promised…
CharacterBios/Kalina/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	In Africa we’ll have adventures like the heroes of my favorite book, “In Desert and Wilderness”. Daddy used to read it to me before I went to sleep. It’s about a little girl Nel and her older friend Staś, who is brave and good, and just like Grozdan.
CharacterBios/Kalina/Story_Step_3/Trauma	I want to have adventures in Africa like Nel and Staś, the heroes of my favorite book, “In Desert and Wilderness”. Here in the city only bad things happen. I want to be far away with mommy and daddy and Grozdan. Why hasn’t he come back yet? He would never leave me behind, would he?
CharacterBios/Kalina/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	Nel and Staś are kidnapped by some bad people, but then escape and have adventures. They travel, meet lions, and even make friends with an elephant! And in the end they meet their parents again and everyone is happy! It will be the same with us, won’t it?
CharacterBios/Kalina/Story_Step_4/Trauma	Even though there were people fighting in Africa too, Staś would never leave Nel, except for one time when he went to look for medicine for her. Grozdan will soon be back, won’t he? I really want him back. And my parents too… I’m not crying, it’s just… I have something in my eye…
CharacterBios/Kalina/EndLog/Good	When the fighting was over, Grozdan came back for Kalina. Their uncle’s family was alright and took them in as their own. They helped Kalina cope with the loss of her parents. She remained religious and many years after the war in Graznavia, she went to Africa with a charity, to help the children there.
CharacterBios/Kalina/EndLog/Mixed	Despite the odds, Grozdan managed to reach their uncle, who took them in as soon as the siege was lifted. Even though her uncle’s family did all they could, Kalina remained a melancholic and quiet child, always reading or daydreaming to escape the real world that had been so harsh to her.
CharacterBios/Kalina/EndLog/Bad	Grozdan managed to reach their uncle’s house, but there was no one there. He came back for Kalina as soon as the ceasefire came into effect. With no adult guardians, they ended up in an orphanage. It was a sad childhood, as they grew up traumatized by the war, having only each other. They never went to Africa.
CharacterBios/Kalina/EndLog/DwellerRejected	The pleas of the young boy to look after his sister until he came back fell on deaf ears. What happened to those children afterwards had better remain a secret.
CharacterBios/Kalina/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	One night, Kalina left the relative safety of the shelter to look for her brother. The other survivors would never hear of her again.
CharacterBios/Kalina/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
CharacterBios/Kalina/Bio	Hello, my name is Kalina, what’s your name? We can be friends. I don’t have many friends now that everyone is fighting. Only my brother. He is my best friend, he looks after me, and says everything will be alright. He went to look for our uncle, who will come for us and take us far away from the angry people who fight each other. And then mommy and daddy will come back.
CharacterBios/Kalina/DwellerCandidate	Hi, I’m Grozdan and this is my younger sister Kalina. We have no place to stay, but our uncle has a house on the outskirts. I can try to reach him, if you look after Kalina for a couple of days. She’s a good girl, she won’t cause any trouble. You look kind-hearted, will you please help us?
CharacterBios/Lydia/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I hope daddy comes back soon. And mommy too. I know they don't like each other now, but they don't argue as much as they did before she moved out. Maybe we'll live together again someday.
CharacterBios/Lydia/Story_Step_1/Trauma	I wish my parents didn't argue so much. Mommy always wanted to move out of the city and dad used to shout at her saying that she wanted us to live like beggars. If they didn't shout so much maybe she would be still with me. I miss her.
CharacterBios/Lydia/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	I called my mom every day after the day she moved out. I would tell her about my friends and she always asked about school and what I had had for dinner. But then the phone stopped working and daddy said it couldn't be fixed.
CharacterBios/Lydia/Story_Step_2/Trauma	I think daddy should be back any time now. I wish I could call my mommy and tell her to come. I used to call her every day when the phone still worked. She promised me that she would come to my birthday. But she didn't.
CharacterBios/Lydia/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	It's taking my daddy an awfully long time to find a new home for us. I hope it will be nice. Our home was very nice, we had a garden and a swing. On my birthday we had a big party with my friends from school. I hoped that my mom would come, but daddy said she couldn't.
CharacterBios/Lydia/Story_Step_3/Trauma	The day before my birthday, I asked daddy if mom was coming. He said he didn't know, that it was dangerous to move around the city. I cried, and he gave me presents to make me stop. My friends came and we had a party, but mom didn't come. It was my worst birthday ever.
CharacterBios/Lydia/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	On the night after my birthday, there was a lot of shooting and shouting outside and in the morning, daddy told me that we had to go. We couldn't even take my doll's pram. I hope those people will stop shooting at each other. Why can't they just sit down and talk it out?
CharacterBios/Lydia/Story_Step_4/Trauma	I couldn't sleep because there were people shouting and shooting in the street. In the morning, dad packed some things and said that we had to run. I left almost all of my toys. Even my new pram. Why do people keep fighting like that? It´s worse than arguing and shouting.
CharacterBios/Lydia/EndLog/Good	After the end of the fighting, Evgeni quickly found Lydia's mother. They are still divorced, but Lydia sees her mother every week. And the big doll house that she got from her is her favorite toy.
CharacterBios/Lydia/EndLog/Mixed	When the war ended, Lydia's mother managed to find her living close to their old place. She insisted that everything that had happened to her was Evgeni's fault.
CharacterBios/Lydia/EndLog/Bad	After the war, Lydia moved with her father to live with their relatives in the country. She has never seen her mother again.
CharacterBios/Lydia/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Evgeni seemed like a resourceful guy, he must have managed to find some other temporary refuge for his ladies.
CharacterBios/Lydia/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Lydia disappeared one quiet night and after wandering the streets for days she was saved by humanitarian workers. After the war, her mother found her through the Red Cross.
CharacterBios/Lydia/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
CharacterBios/Lydia/Bio	What did you get for your birthday? I got a pram for my doll and a t-shirt with a princess on it from my daddy. I don't know what my mom will give me. She's not living at home anymore. And now she won't find us here, daddy says he left her a message but he didn't know what address to use, but he says he'll let her know somehow. I hope she comes back and stays with me. Even if she doesn't have any presents. I know it's hard to get presents now.
CharacterBios/Misha/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	When will Daniel come back? He's my friend. I didn't know him so well before but he has been really nice to me since he found me. I hope he comes back soon with my parents. I miss them. I was sitting at the big table with them eating breakfast when the soldiers came and said that there was an evacuation and that we had to get to the trucks.
CharacterBios/Misha/Story_Step_1/Trauma	Do you think something happened to Daniel? He said he'll be back soon. Did he lie? He lived next to us but I didn't know him so well. I miss him now. I miss my parents. The last time I saw them was when we were eating breakfast and the soldiers started banging on the door and shouting that we had to get to the trucks because there was an evacuation.
CharacterBios/Misha/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	My mom and dad started grabbing and packing things and I told them I had to go and get Roxy. I found her on the next street, but when we returned, everybody had gone. Daniel later said they thought that I must have already got on another truck. I fed Roxy and I had some milk and cookies, and we went to sleep.
CharacterBios/Misha/Story_Step_2/Trauma	My parents started to run to and fro grabbing things and I said I’d go and get Roxy. I found her on the next street and took her to my parents. But they left without me. They always said they'd never ever leave me, but they lied. I ate cookies and I gave Roxy her food. And then we waited. But they didn't come.
CharacterBios/Misha/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	One night, Roxy woke me up barking loudly and I heard terrible noises. I hid in my hideout because I knew that the thieves had come. Roxy fought them but they shot her. She saved my life. The thieves had left by morning, but they made a terrible mess and stole all our food.
CharacterBios/Misha/Story_Step_3/Trauma	One night, Roxy started to growl and bark and I heard a bang and then she started to whine and there was another bang. I was in my hideout and I wanted to help her but I was scared. I heard steps and noises all through the night, and in the morning I found Roxy and she was dead. And there was no food left.
CharacterBios/Misha/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	I buried Roxy with her bowl and her toys and her blanket, and I marked the place on the wall. I didn't know what to do, so I waited. Then Daniel found me and took me with him. He said that Roxy is in heaven for saving me, and that one day I'll see her again. I just wish she was here, and my parents too. I have so much to tell them.
CharacterBios/Misha/Story_Step_4/Trauma	I dug a hole and put her in and I had to cover her with earth because that's what you do. Her paws were sticking out and I couldn't bend them, so I brought sand from the sandbox. Then Daniel came and took me with him. He said Roxy is in heaven and promised to find my parents. But I think he lied. I think they're with Roxy.
CharacterBios/Misha/EndLog/Good	Daniel quickly found Misha's parents and there was a tearful, joyous reunion. The nightmares soon ended and Misha recovered fully.
CharacterBios/Misha/EndLog/Mixed	Daniel eventually managed to locate Misha's parents, but the family never returned to their home in Pogoren, marred by the dreadful memories.
CharacterBios/Misha/EndLog/Bad	Misha had to wait a long time for his parents. They were eventually reunited, but what they had lived through changed them all forever.
CharacterBios/Misha/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Daniel found another temporary home for Misha, he managed to slip through the front line and locate Misha's parents, but they had to wait for the end of fighting before returning.
CharacterBios/Misha/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Misha ran away in the middle of the night and was taken in by a childless couple. He was eventually reunited with his parents.
CharacterBios/Misha/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
CharacterBios/Misha/Bio	Why don't you have a dog? I had a dog when I was living with my parents. Her name was Roxy and my dad gave her to me. You should get a dog. It should be big, bigger than Roxy, and with big teeth! Roxy was small because our apartment was small. But she was the best anyway. I taught her to fetch.
CharacterBios/Misha/DwellerCandidate	Thank heavens! I'm Daniel, and this is Misha, my neighbors' kid. Could you take care of him for a few days? I promised him I’d find his parents and I won't risk sneaking out of the city with a child in tow.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	I... kind of lied about my parents. I'm sorry. I was in an orphanage since I was very small. I thought that you'd change your mind if you knew. But Oleg is real! We're not related, but we swore to be like brothers.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Story_Step_1/Trauma	You know, what I told you about myself is not all true. We're not so rich and... actually the only true part was about my brother. Only he's not my real brother. I'm sorry. I was afraid you'd kick me out if you knew I was an orphan.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	So my brother Oleg, he's really smart, but on the smaller side, and the other kids kept pushing him around. Especially Vano, a big boy who was almost a grown-up. Nobody would stand up to him. So one night I sneaked into his dorm.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Story_Step_2/Trauma	Oleg is a bit small and he was often bullied. And there was this guy Vano who really shouldn't be still in school, he was almost a grown-up, and he... liked to do things to kids. Adult things. And Oleg told me he tickled him and said that he'll "have fun" with him soon.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	I left pincers stolen from the workshop on his bed, and I stuck a note to his pillow: "If you touch Oleg, you'll never count to 10 on your fingers again." And that was the end of it. Afterwards Oleg and I swore to each other that from now on we'd be like brothers.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Story_Step_3/Trauma	I sneaked into Vano's dorm at night and put a blade to his throat, and when he woke up, I whispered that I'll carve him a second smile if he so much as looks at Oleg. And that was the end of it. Afterwards Oleg and I swore to each other that from now on we'd be like brothers.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	We were meant to be flown out of town before it got really bad, but there was not enough space on the plane. So older kids had to stay. But when we returned to the school, the army arrested all the staff and told us to go away. When it's over, I'm going to find Oleg, whatever it takes.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Story_Step_4/Trauma	When the shells started to fall, they took us to the airport to fly us from Pogoren. Oleg went on the plane and I was left behind. And when I returned to school, the army rounded up all the staff and told us to get lost. I'll probably never see Oleg again.
CharacterBios/Sergei/EndLog/Good	As soon as it was possible, Sergei started inquiring about Oleg and after a few months they were reunited in a new foster home.
CharacterBios/Sergei/EndLog/Mixed	It took a long time for the bad memories to fade, but Sergei's life took a turn for the better when Oleg and his new foster parents found him at last.
CharacterBios/Sergei/EndLog/Bad	After the war Sergei did what he could to forget his ordeal. Soon he landed in a juvenile detention center for theft and burglary.
CharacterBios/Sergei/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Sergei's plea was turned down, but he somehow managed to survive till the war's end.
CharacterBios/Sergei/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Sergei decided he'd be better off on his own and wandered away one night. Some good people found him lying in the street and took him in.
CharacterBios/Sergei/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
CharacterBios/Sergei/Bio	Thanks for letting me in. My parents are very rich and they'll find a way to make it up to you when it's all over. I lived with them in a big house up there on the hill, and we had everything, even a swimming pool! And I had my own bike, and a rifle, and my father took me hunting once... No, actually several times. We were very happy. When this is over my parents will come to pick me up and I'll introduce you to my younger brother. His name is Oleg and he's very smart!
CharacterBios/Sergei/DwellerCandidate	Please, can I stay with you? I'm hungry and I have nowhere to go... The army took over my home and kicked me out and I don't know what happened to my parents. Please, let me in, I don't eat much and I'll behave, I promise!
CharacterBios/Christo/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	Many people in our area moved to their basements as a precaution. We all felt much safer there, even though the life conditions were not the best. I heard stories of people buried alive in their basements, but I didn't tell them to Iskra, I didn't want her to be afraid.
CharacterBios/Christo/Story_Step_1/Trauma	The shellings forced many people from our area to cower in their basements. The walls would shake, the plaster would fall off the ceiling. We would huddle down in fear, Iskra in tears. Everyone thought of the possibility of getting buried alive.
CharacterBios/Christo/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	When a shell hit our house, burying our neighbors in their basement, everyone rushed to help. We managed to pull out our neighbor and her son, but her husband had been crushed. Iskra did not see him, but since that day she has been having nightmares of being buried beneath the rubble.
CharacterBios/Christo/Story_Step_2/Trauma	One day our tenement was hit by a shell. We survived, but our neighbors were less fortunate. Their basement collapsed, burying them underneath tons of rubble. We managed to pull out our neighbor and her son, but her husband was crushed. Iskra saw his mangled body and has had horrible nightmares ever since.
CharacterBios/Christo/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	Despite my daughter’s fears, I decided that staying in the basement was safer than not. I thought of it as a temporary arrangement. I didn't expected the siege to last very long, but it turned out we spent many months there. Everyone from our tenement shared whatever they had and helped each other.
CharacterBios/Christo/Story_Step_3/Trauma	After that fateful day, we no longer felt any safer staying in the basement, but we had nowhere to go regardless. Our days became bleak as our supplies dwindled, and every day could be our last. It seemed like the siege would last forever, and I started losing hope of seeing my wife ever again.
CharacterBios/Christo/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	One day the soldiers came and told us to get out. They gave everyone a minute or two to evacuate, and then they threw in grenades. People they suspected of helping the rebels were shot on sight. They let us go because Iskra had no one else but me.
CharacterBios/Christo/Story_Step_4/Trauma	All this ended, when, one day, soldiers came to our house. They were sweeping the city for rebels and their supporters, throwing grenades into random basements. We weren't there when it happened, but most of our neighbors were killed. We didn't go down there to grab our things. We left, never to come back.
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/Good	When the war ended, Christo managed to reunite with his wife. Luckily she was unhurt. They resumed work, and did their best to alleviate the effects war had on Iskra, as well as ensure she had a normal childhood. Perhaps with a lot of love and care, they would succeed.
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/Mixed	Christo's family reunion was a bittersweet one. Though they were all alive, Christo's experiences changed him, making him quiet and withdrawn. Even when peace settled in, he rarely participated in social meetings, preferring to spend time alone and if possible, outdoors.
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/Bad	Despite his family's reunion after the ceasefire, Christo could not forget the horrors of war, and that changed him. His wife tried to help him, but he pushed her away, and they slowly grew apart. They stayed together for Iskra's sake, but their marriage was nothing but an empty shell of what it had been.
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/DwellerDied	Christo died during the siege of Pogoren, leaving Iskra with only her mother and grandmother. She would always miss him.
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Christo and his daughter had to look for some other place to stay. Hopefully they got lucky, and survived the war. We will probably never know.
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Desperate, Christo left the shelter one night, never to come back.
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/Suicide	Completely broken, Christo chose to take his own life. How did it come to pass?
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	One night, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter taking ^OtherCharacterName^ with {ms|him}{fs|her}. They somehow managed to reach a refugee camp, where they spent the rest of the war.
CharacterBios/Christo/Bio	We used to live not far from here. When the first shellings started, we moved into the basement for safety. We tried to make it as comfortable as possible, but it was still cold, dark and damp. There were also rats. Iskra is afraid of them, but I told her she had to be strong. She spent most of the time in that basement, while I went out each day to get some supplies.
CharacterBios/Christo/DeathNote	With Christo dead, little Iskra will only have her mother left.
CharacterBios/Christo/DwellerCandidate	Hello, my name is Christo, and this is my daughter Iskra. We had been living in the basement of our house for the last couple of months but the soldiers forced us to leave. You look like decent people, so I'll ask you straight: Can we stay with you? Iskra is too young, but I'll work to earn it. As a teenager I used to help my parents a lot in chopping wood to heat our house, so that can be my duty here as well. What do you say?
CharacterBios/Henrik/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	It's not easy to look after my grandson in the midst of all this chaos, but I have no choice. My son is an idealist, and believes he is fighting for a better future for Ivano. The boy adores him, and believes his dad is a hero. I just hope he's alright.
CharacterBios/Henrik/Story_Step_1/Trauma	Can you hear the shots? Every time I hear them I think of my son. Is he the one firing? Is he under fire, about to die? This whole war is madness. I tried to talk some reason into my son, but he wouldn't listen. He has always defied me.
CharacterBios/Henrik/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	I know my son fell victim to clever propaganda. I do not know who is really behind this war, or who will benefit from it, but I'm sure it won't be the Vyseni people. Graznavia has been a multicultural country for centuries, this attempt at secession doesn't make much sense.
CharacterBios/Henrik/Story_Step_2/Trauma	My son kept prattling about the liberation of the Vyseni people from Grazni oppression, about freedom and independence. Catchy words, used by the hatemongers. We lived alongside the Grazni in peace for centuries, why kill them now? But as soon as the opportunity arose he joined those damned “liberation” forces.
CharacterBios/Henrik/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	I hope this foolish son of mine doesn't get himself killed. Ivano needs a father, even more so than other kids, since he never knew his mother. The boy looks up to my son, and emulates him in everything. I'm glad he isn't older, or he would've gone fighting too.
CharacterBios/Henrik/Story_Step_3/Trauma	My son doesn't come over to visit. He used to do so when the conflict began, but now that both sides are bogged down in protracted siege, I never see him. Not that it would be easy for him to find us here. Our house is ruined, and I have no way of letting him know where we are.
CharacterBios/Henrik/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	I wonder where my son is now... is he leading his colleagues to battle? Hiding from mortar fire in some trench? Killing Grazni informers? Smoking a cigarette, oblivious and numb, knowing that his cause is lost? I don't care, I just want to hug my son again.
CharacterBios/Henrik/Story_Step_4/Trauma	I have so many questions I'd like to ask my son... What is the point of this goddamn war? How many people has he killed? Did he commit atrocities against civilians? Is he a war criminal? But for all I know, I might never see him again. What will I tell Ivano then?
CharacterBios/Henrik/EndLog/Good	The end of war could not come soon enough for the desperate residents of Pogoren. The city was once more open, but Henrik's son did not return. He could be dead or in hiding, but deep inside, Henrik knew he did not commit any war crimes, and he kept only fond memories of him. Ivano became his chance to correct his past mistakes.
CharacterBios/Christo/EndLog/MixedAlternate	Christo's family reunion was a bittersweet one. Though they were all alive, Christo's experiences changed him, making him quiet and withdrawn. Even when peace settled in, he rarely participated in social meetings, preferring to spend time alone and if possible, outdoors.
CharacterBios/Henrik/EndLog/Bad	For Henrik, the end of war did not mean the end of suffering. His son was killed during the siege. His unit was believed to have committed numerous crimes against the civilian population. Henrik was shattered and became bitter and apathetic. He took his son’s faults as his own failure.
CharacterBios/Henrik/EndLog/DwellerDied	Sadly, Henrik died before he had the chance to reconcile with his son.
CharacterBios/Henrik/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Despite their pleading, the old man and his grandson had to look for another place to stay.
CharacterBios/Henrik/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Henrik disappeared from the shelter in the dead of night. He set out to find his son, but only learned where he was buried.
CharacterBios/Henrik/EndLog/Suicide	Pushed to the edge, Henrik decided life was no longer worth living. What would become of Ivano?
CharacterBios/Henrik/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	One night, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter taking ^OtherCharacterName^ with {ms|him}{fs|her}. They somehow managed to reach a refugee camp, where they spent the rest of the war.
CharacterBios/Henrik/Bio	I regret we could not meet in other circumstances. Before this whole damned affair, I had been enjoying my retirement and looking after Ivano, when my son was at work. When those pro-secessionists started rousing the Vyseni minority, I told my son nothing good would come of it, but he wouldn't listen. He was captivated by the idea of independent Republic of Vysena. He joined the rebels, leaving Ivano with me. I haven't seen him since the siege began.
CharacterBios/Henrik/DeathNote	Poor Henrik. With him dead, what will become of Ivano?
CharacterBios/Henrik/DwellerCandidate	Good morning, my name is Henrik, and this brave boy here is my grandson Ivano. We see you’ve taken refuge in this building, and were wondering if perhaps we could join you here? The more the merrier, they say, and I can be useful too. When the going was tough, I used to make moonshine and cigarettes to sell, and I could do it now as well. So, what do you say?
CharacterBios/Irina/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	This place is definitely better than the street, but I wish we could still live in the house Evgeni built for his family. It was small, but so nice! And the garden was just delightful. I used to spend most of my free time there when I moved in.
CharacterBios/Irina/Story_Step_1/Trauma	Oh, things aren't really looking up, are they? We used to live in a really nice house my brother built, and to move here... This isn't a proper place for a child, although it's better than freezing in the street, I guess. I just hope I can make it a bit more bearable with some plants.
CharacterBios/Irina/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	There is absolutely no reason to worry about Evgeni. He's really resourceful, I'm sure he'll be back soon. His wife was mad to leave him. Perhaps she had been right when she said it would be best for them to move to the country, but who knew what was coming?
CharacterBios/Irina/Story_Step_2/Trauma	I'm sure Evgeni knows what he's doing, but I'm starting to worry. Why hasn't he returned yet? He was always full of ideas, but some of them just stank. Like marrying that harpy. The only good thing she did was leaving him. If only poor Lydia understood this.
CharacterBios/Irina/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	Lydia is lucky to have such a doting father. Well, were she mine, I'd be doting over her too. I try not to spoil her too much, but Evgeni should go about finding someone suitable, and soon. She needs a proper mother.
CharacterBios/Irina/Story_Step_3/Trauma	Evgeni has always been the perfect father. His daughter means everything to him. It's really troubling that he's away for so long, she misses him, poor dear. I worry that something serious must've happened to him.
CharacterBios/Irina/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	I can't imagine what's taking Evgeni so long, but he better throw a big party when he returns. Lydia is beside herself and I just don't know how to appease her anymore. Well, we can only carry on and wait some more...
CharacterBios/Irina/Story_Step_4/Trauma	Why hasn't my brother married someone suitable? Lydia wouldn't have to live without a mother, and I dread that I'll have to explain to her that her father won't return for some time, if ever... Why has it happened to this poor child?!
CharacterBios/Irina/EndLog/Good	After the fighting ceased, Evgeni finally managed to return. When he related his ordeals to his sister, she forgave him instantly.
CharacterBios/Irina/EndLog/Mixed	When Evgeni managed to find his daughter and sister, Irina berated him for months for, as she said, "abandoning" them. But she eventually got over it.
CharacterBios/Irina/EndLog/Bad	Evgeni eventually managed to get back to her daughter and sister, but Irina couldn't forgive him for, as she insisted on calling it, "abandoning" them.
CharacterBios/Irina/EndLog/DwellerDied	Lydia cried for weeks for her aunt, and Evgeni was broken upon learning about Irina's death.
CharacterBios/Irina/EndLog/DwellerRejected	Evgeni seemed like a resourceful guy, he must have managed to find some other temporary refuge for his ladies.
CharacterBios/Irina/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Irina decided she would not stay a day longer in the shelter. She spent the rest of the war in a refugee camp.
CharacterBios/Irina/EndLog/Suicide	Nobody expected Irina to take her own life. She didn't seem like a person capable of doing such a thing.
CharacterBios/Irina/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	One night, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter taking ^OtherCharacterName^ with {ms|him}{fs|her}. They somehow managed to reach a refugee camp, where they spent the rest of the war.
CharacterBios/Irina/Bio	Poor Lydia, what she has to go through! First her mother leaves her, and now this! There are so many bad people in the world, I tell you, and to think that this sweet girl has one of them as her mother... Sorry, you probably have enough on your mind already. I joke that I always had a better way with plants than with people, I love to help them grow lush, healthy and delicious.
CharacterBios/Irina/DeathNote	Here lies Irina, who meant nobody any harm. I hope Evgeni is alright, for Lydia's sake.
CharacterBios/Irina/DwellerCandidate	Great! Look, I have to ask you for a favor, but you won't regret it, I promise. I had to flee from my home with my daughter and sister, but I know some people who owe me - I just need to meet them and arrange for a place for us and squeeze them for some supplies. And I'll share them with you when I'm back for my ladies.

LocationsTexts/001_scav_ghost_house/Description	A man who lived there used to give shelter to people in need. He either died or fled after his home has been ravaged by mortar fire. Since then the house stands abandoned, and neighborhood kids say that it's haunted.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_ghost_house/FirstEnterComment	It’s deserted… I don’t expect to meet anyone inside.
LocationsTexts/001_scav_ghost_house/StoryItem_01	Dear Subira! Just when I managed to reach this country we thought to be safe, it too was plunged into war. Don't worry though, I'm fine. I write this letter waiting for a man who can smuggle me to safety in his boat. I will then apply for the asylum, and as soon as I get it, I'll bring you here, and we'll be together again, away from war and misery. Hang on and pray for me. Kofi.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingToPlayer/01	Ahoy my friend! I'm Karel.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingToPlayer/02	Would you like to get away from this place?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingToPlayer/03	I can get you and your family to safety. Trust me.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingToPlayer/04	I did it many times. Plenty of people want out.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingToPlayer/05	I've heard of you from the trader. I'll swing by in a while. Think about my offer.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingToPlayer/showingBoat_01	Wanna take a look at my boat?
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingToPlayer/showingBoat_02	Here it is, big enough don't you think?

NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingRadio/02	No, still nothing.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/020/TalkingRadio/03	I'll let you know when I have someone.

CharacterBios/Marko/EndLog/GoodAlternate	Soon after Marko stepped out of the boat, he found his wife and kids, who avoided the worst atrocities hidden away by a kind family.

CharacterBios/Katia/EndLog/GoodAlternate	Once she left Pogoren, Katia used her contacts to find her parents in a refugee camp abroad.

StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/SPECTATOR_LOG/Homie/01	This Karel guy ^CharacterName^ met seems sketchy... But we could all be safe a week from now!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/SPECTATOR_LOG/Survivalist/01	The boatman ^CharacterName^ met gives us the only chance to evacuate. I think we should take it.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/HERO_LOG/Egoist/02	This Karel guy might smuggle me out of the city! I only fear that I won't have enough to pay him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/HERO_LOG/Egoist/03	I can't believe my luck. I could escape this hell, if only I manage to pay the smuggler!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/02	This boatman, Karel, is saving lives and that's what matters. Unless he lied to me...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/HERO_LOG/Altruistic/03	That smuggler is running a lifeline - I only hope he doesn't cheat those who trust him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/HERO_LOG/Homie/02	People are desperate to get out of Pogoren. I wonder though if this smuggler can be trusted.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/HERO_LOG/Homie/03	Paying the smuggler for the passage means betting everything on one card. But... to be safe again...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/02	If I gave this smuggler everything I'd still think I made a deal. But I have to keep my eye on him.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/HERO_LOG/Survivalist/03	It's worth to take the chance to get out offered by this smuggler. I don't think he'll dare to con me.

StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/EspaceOfferReceived/SPECTATOR_LOG/Altruistic/03	Karel, the smuggler ^CharacterName^ met, runs a vital service. For a price, of course - I hope we'll be able to pay it.

NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/OldManTrader/OfferedItemGrades/1/00	You would have to offer us significant help.

CharacterBios/Adam/Story_Step_1/NoTrauma	Everyone should choose one happy memory. And it can’t just be good, it has to be grand. When it gets so bad you just want to sit down and cry, when your life seems forfeit, you close your eyes and go back to your happy moment. It’s not easy, but you have to try.
CharacterBios/Adam/Story_Step_1/Trauma	My father told me that I should choose one happy memory. And when the life becomes miserable, I just have to close my eyes and go back to that happy moment. But what do you do when your happiest memory brings you nothing but pain?
CharacterBios/Adam/Story_Step_2/NoTrauma	We were called to a tenement fire. I was still the new one on our team. We just started assembling the hoses, when a resident shouted that there was someone inside. I donned the mask, went in and carried out a young lady. Long story short, we got married soon after. Her name was Alina.
CharacterBios/Adam/Story_Step_2/Trauma	My happiest moment is a memory of a fire. I was a new addition to our team and guys used to tease me, calling me names, but it was a friendly ribbing. Long story short, we were called to a tenement fire and I got lucky, rescued a young lady and became the old hand right there. And that lady, Alina was her name, became my wife soon after.
CharacterBios/Adam/Story_Step_3/NoTrauma	Alina gave me two beautiful girls. We were so happy. When the war broke out, we decided they would be safer at my mother’s house in the country. I stayed with my team to help people. We thought all this would be over in a couple of weeks. It’s been almost three years now. Phones are dead, so I’ve been sending letters through anyone leaving the city.
CharacterBios/Adam/Story_Step_3/Trauma	We had two kids, two beautiful daughters. When the war started, she took them and moved to the country, to my mother. She wanted me to come but I’d never leave my team in times like these. We had a lot of fires to fight. Then, there were more fires than we could fight... and later on the team was no more. It turned out I couldn’t leave the city.
CharacterBios/Adam/Story_Step_4/NoTrauma	I’ve got no reply yet and I’m really worried. But I have to trust that Alina and the girls are fine and that everything is going to be alright, or I’ll go mad. When this siege is over, I'll find them no matter what and I won't let anything separate us ever again. I hope that one day we can forget this war ever happened and think of it as just a bad dream.
CharacterBios/Adam/Story_Step_4/Trauma	I've had no word from them for months now. There is no way to reach them, no phones, no mail, I’ve tried to give letters to strangers, but haven’t heard back. I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever see my Alina and my daughters alive. And this slowly drives me crazy. I wish I could get my hands on whoever started this madness.
CharacterBios/Adam/EndLog/Good	Adam lived to see the end of the fighting, but he failed to learn what really happened to Amelia. He never saw her again.

CharacterBios/Adam/EndLog/DwellerDied	Adam died before he managed to learn the truth about what happened to Amelia.
CharacterBios/Adam/EndLog/DwellerRejected	It was a tough decision but there were reasons why Marko could not stay in the shelter.
CharacterBios/Adam/EndLog/DwellerLeftShelter	Marko slipped out of the shelter one night, leaving no notes behind. He died, betrayed by a smuggler, while trying to reach his family.
CharacterBios/Adam/EndLog/Suicide	Adam chose what he believed was the quickest way to be with his cdaughter and wife again.
CharacterBios/Adam/EndLog/ChildLeftShelter	One night, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter taking ^OtherCharacterName^ with {ms|him}{fs|her}. They somehow managed to reach a refugee camp, where they spent the rest of the war.
CharacterBios/Adam/Bio	It feels like just yesterday I buried Barbara, and now Amelia is ill as well. This damn war will not take my daughter away from me. I will not allow it. I'll find a way to save her.
CharacterBios/Adam/DwellerCandidate	Sorry to disturb you, funny how life turns out. I'm a fireman, I've been saving people all my life. Now I'm the one that needs saving. My family fled to the country. I wanted to go to them, but the city got encircled and I couldn't. Will you let me stay with you?
CharacterBios/Adam/DeathNote	It’s Marko’s body. He used to save people’s lives and now he lies dead and abandoned. He deserved better.
DailyLog/IntroMessageWarStories_adam	Adam's family failed to flee the city in time, but they managed to get by somehow despite the siege... Until one day Adam's wife fell ill. Without the proper meds, Barbara died. After her mother's death Amelia became completely withdrawn and stopped speaking. Then she fell ill.

One night an explosion shook their tenement, but fortunately they survived. Adam carried Amelia to the other wing of the building, desperate to save his daughter.

Radio/Nina/comments/00	Oh God, thank you! My sunshine is alive!
Radio/Nina/comments/01	I'm sure she's right about the toy store. I'll find a new plush dog there.
Radio/Nina/comments/02	I need to get a grip on myself and find that toy.
Radio/Nina/comments/03	Soon, my sweetie... I will see you again...
Radio/Nina/comments/04	Yes, that old man just wants to survive. I must find a gun for him.
Radio/Nina/comments/05	Pull yourself together, man! You have to do it! For your daugther!
Radio/Nina/comments/06	I have to try again... I miss them so much!
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/SawMassacreInCemetary/00	The people intending to use the humanitarian corridor were massacred. So many bodies...
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/RescuredDoctorInToyStore/00	I managed to save the doctor from those murderers, and he told me to talk to father Damir at the church. He knows where Amelia is. Soon we'll be together again.

StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/FoundDeadDoctorInToyStore/00	The poor doctor was tortured to death... I wanted to help him, but what was I to do?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/GotInfoAboutCemetary/00	The humanitarian corridor is to be opened near the church. That's where I'll find Amelia.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/GotInfoAboutDeadWoman/00	I hear that the woman who'd had Amelia's hoodie died. Maybe she'd be alive if I hadn't retrieved it from her... But Barbara had given it to Amelia, and she needs it more.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/StoleAmeliaHoodie/00	I retrieved Amelia's hoodie from the woman who'd had it. It breaks my heart to know my poor girl is out there, shivering from cold! How can anyone be so callous as to rob a sick child of her hoodie!?
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/GotInfoAboutDoctor/00	When I got to the hospital Amelia had already been taken somewhere else. I must talk to that doctor before those soldiers kill him, or I may never find her!

StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/FoundNotesAboutPharmacy/00	My brother must've taken Amelia, and is planning to escape with her via the humanitarian corridor. He'll visit his pharmacy and take what he can before going to the rally point. I must catch them at the pharmacy!

And don't worry about me - a man offered to smuggle me out of the city and I am going to take this opportunity. Be well.

Your loving sister,

Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Intro_Soldier_doctor_part2/Ofiara_03	For many... it was the last chance... especially for the sick children...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Intro_Soldier_doctor_part2/Oprawca_02	Spill it!
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore/03	Someone knew that the massacre would happen, but didn't warn the people... Bastard!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Intro_Soldier_doctor_part3/Oprawca_05	Let's wrap this up. He's of no use to us anymore.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Intro_Soldier_doctor_part3/Ofiara_06	No! I beg you... I told you everything... The patients need my help!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Intro_Soldier_doctor_part3/Oprawca_06	They'll have to get by without you.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Doctor/00	No, please... Don't hurt me anymore!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Doctor/01	Relax, you're safe now. My daughter, Amelia, was brought to your hospital, where is she now?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Doctor/02	Thank you... I thought I was done for...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Doctor/03	I... I don't remember anything... They've kept me here so long...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Doctor/04	Where is she?! Was she taken to the humanitarian corridor?
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore/00	I don't see any soldiers yet, but I must be careful.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/CheckInjuredPpls/00	We need blood... lots of blood as soon as possible.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/CheckInjuredPpls/01	Hold on... You will make it. I promise.
LocationsTexts/WarStories/Story1/003_cementary/Investigation_item_02	More bodies... Someone rounded up these people and killed them in cold blood... It was a massacre.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetFirstTimeNeutral/00	Are you alright? Thank God.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	Damn murderers... We need help!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	So many wounded...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	Don't just stand there, do something!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/03	We need blood. Lots of it!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Nurse/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/04	God help us...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Priest/00	Excuse me, Father. I'm looking for my daughter, Amelia.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/GuardAboutDoctor/04	But, I can tell that you're deperate, so... There's an abandoned toy store nearby.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Priest/02	She didn't...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Priest/03	Thanks goodness! Is she here?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Cemetary_Priest/04	She is, you can go to her. My prayers are with her.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/01/006	Oh, you can even kill me, but who will tell you where your daughter is, mister Angry Father?
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/School/00	I need to ask around. Someone must have seen something.
LocationsTexts/018_hospital/Investigation_item_01	There's a hoodie on the bed. It looks remarkably like the one Amelia was wearing... I'm pretty sure it's the same one!

It used to be her mother's... How did this woman come to have it? I must ask her!
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/DialogBefore/07	Want to save her? Bring me the food. I'll wait here.
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/Title	Bring me food.
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/Description	I want food in exchange for information. I prefer canned food, but raw food will do in a pinch. See how generous I am?
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/OnYesDialog/02	Some guy, about your size, was carrying her towards the hospital.
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/DialogBefore/00	I'm looking for my missing daughter. A little blonde girl.
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/DialogBefore/01	Oh yeah, I've seen her...
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/DialogBefore/02	Oh my God! Really? Please, tell me everything you know!
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/DialogBefore/03	You help me first, then I help you. I'm very hungry...
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/DialogBefore/04	If you bring me some food, I'll tell you what I know.
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/OnYesDialog/03	The hospital... You'd better be right. For your own sake.
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/DialogBefore/05	How about you tell me now and I don't kick the shit out of you?
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/DialogBefore/06	Oh, I won't tell you anything if you hurt me. And if you kill me, you'll never find your daughter.
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/OnYesDialog/01	No need to be rude. There isn't much to tell. I've seen a blonde girl, maybe ten years old.
GameFlow/Quests/WarStories/Story1/NeedFood/OnYesDialog/00	Here's your food, you greedy bastard. Now spill it.
LocationsTexts/WarStories/Story1/001_pharmacy/Investigation_item_10	The footprints lead upstairs. There are bloodstains too.
LocationsTexts/WarStories/Story1/001_pharmacy/Investigation_item_11	Whoever it was, they must have turned around towards the back alley door.
LocationsTexts/WarStories/Story1/001_pharmacy/Investigation_item_12	The door is unlocked and there's blood on the door handle. I need to check the back alley.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Day8_AndMoreIfGotKnowAboutToyStore/CasualSpeeche/02	I hope I can talk to that doctor before it's too late.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Day9_AndMoreIfGotKnowAboutCemetary/CasualSpeeche/01	It's been so long... Will Amelia still be at the church?
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Day9_AndMoreIfGotKnowAboutCemetary/CasualSpeeche/00	Everything points to the church.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Day8_AndMoreIfGotKnowAboutToyStore/CasualSpeeche/01	The doctor taken by the soldiers is my only shot at finding Amelia...
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Day8_AndMoreIfGotKnowAboutToyStore/CasualSpeeche/00	I need to go to the toy store.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/01/04	Say... I'll tell you what I know if you bring me some food, alright?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/01/005	How about you tell me now and I don't kick the shit out of you?

LocationsTexts/001_scav_cpn/Name_WS_Story1	Looted Gas Station
LocationsTexts/001_scav_cpn/Description_WS_Story1	This gas station has already been looted, but the trail led to either school or there. Maybe Amelia's captor is trying to leave the city that way. Can I still catch up to them?
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore/01	The church! That's where the doctor was sending children!
Items/Keys/KeyPharmacyBackDoor_Name	Brother's Pharmacy keys
Items/Keys/KeyPharmacyBackDoor_Description	My brother has always kept his keys on him, it's strange that they were lying on the ground. I can use them to open locked doors in the pharmacy.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/BrotherHome/06	Brother! Amelia! Are you here?!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Soldier/Intro/00	Receiving!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Soldier/Dialogue/00	Get out of here while you still can!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Soldier/Dialogue/01	I need to get inside. Don't stand in my way.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Soldier/Dialogue/02	Last warning. Get the fuck out of here or die.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Soldier/Intro/01	Yes sir, we've got him!
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Soldier/Intro/02	Yes, the boys are working on him as we speak... He'll talk.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Soldier/Intro/03	Understood. We'll dispose of him afterwards.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Soldier/Intro/04	Over and out!
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/BrotherHome/07	They're not here... Damn it! Maybe there are clues to their wherebouts in those papers.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/BrotherHome/08	Locked...This is where my brother stores his gun. He probably has the keys on him.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/BrotherHome/09	No gun... He must have taken it.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/00/02	You don't understand, she's very ill! If you know something, you must tell me!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/00/03	You got hearing problems? I said fuck off!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/03/00	Have you seen a man with a ten-year-old girl? She's my daughter.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/03/01	Haven't seen any kids in a while...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/03/02	But I've seen some soldiers.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/03/03	Them bastards are worse than bandits...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/03/04	Bloody rapists and murderers. Pray it's not them that got your kid...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/03/05	She is very ill... they wouldn't hurt an ill child, would they?
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/School/02	A pile of papers. All rubbish, except for a note that mentions the humanitarian corridor:

"We need to flee the city somehow, and soon. I've learned of a humanitarian corridor to be opened in a couple of days, for the wounded and children. To use it we need to either get seriously wounded... or have some children with us.
I'm sure you understand which option I prefer."
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/School/03	Kidnapping a child as a pass to flee the city? Oh God...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/04/00	Excuse me ma'm, I'm looking for my daughter. Have you seen her?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/04/01	What? A child...? Oh my God...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/04/02	What happened?! Do you know something? You must tell me!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/04/03	My own child was taken away from me... My poor boy, he was only seven...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Dream/09	She's gone.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/006_school/04/05	Now he's gone... Why did you remind me of him?! Why can't I just forget what happened?! Leave me alone!
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Shelter/00	A large photo of Adam and his family. There's his wife and daughter, their parents and his brother. Someone clearly tried to scratch out his brother from the photo.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Shelter/01	Partially burned Adam's diary. The surviving entries read:

"I buried Barbara today. It's just the two of us now. We kept her hoodie and Amelia wears it all the time. She believes it will protect her from harm.

Could I have saved Barbara if I had kept in touch with my brother? No, I know him all too well. He'd never share meds with us. Filthy speculator, he'll take advantage of other people's misery to get rich."
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Shelter/02	Life's so hard without her...
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Shelter/03	God...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/04/02	Excuse me? I haven't seen any children in a while.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/04/03	The hoodie is mine now, finders keepers.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/04/04	Where did you find it?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/04/05	It was lying on the floor in that room, behind the hole.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/04/06	But you won't find anything there, a part of the celiling has collapsed during the bombing.
LocationsTexts/018_hospital/Investigation_item_02	Not much left here... Wait, there's something! Partially burned hospital documents, I should have a look.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/00	Amelia was here... The doctor must know something. I need to find him!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/04/WantsBack/00	Can I have it back, please?
LocationsTexts/018_hospital/Investigation_item_03	Some numbers next to names... I don't know what the numbers mean, but... Amelia's name is mentioned.

She's been here!




Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieFirstMeet/00	Excuse me, this hoodie over there belongs to my daughter.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieFirstMeet/01	How did you get it?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieFirstMeet/02	I got it from a nurse. Ask her if you don't believe me.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieFirstMeet/03	The nights are very cold here, especially now after the bombing.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieTryToGet/00	I'll have the hoodie back. My daughter must miss it.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieTryToGet/01	I haven't seen your daughter, I got it from a nurse!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieTryToGet/02	And I'm not giving it back, it keeps me warm!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieTryToGet/03	Leave me alone!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutHoodie/00	The woman from the second floor told me you gave her a hoodie.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutHoodie/01	As a matter of fact, it belongs to my daughter. Do you know where she is?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutHoodie/02	Oh... We've had some children here...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutHoodie/03	Maybe doctor Jefimow could help you... But last night he was taken by the soldiers.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutHoodie/04	Do you know where they took him?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutHoodie/05	The security guard by the entrance might know.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutHoodie/06	As to the hoodie... I've found it discarded on the second floor.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutHoodie/07	I'd appreciate if you didn't take it. We're very short on blankets and warm clothes.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/GuardAboutDoctor/00	I hear you might know where the doctor was taken?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/02/00	I'm looking for my daughter. A short blonde. Have you seen her?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/02/03	Yeah, right. You're not the first rebel to try to flee the city in the guise of an innocent parent.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/02/04	I can tell you have blood on your hands. Don't try anything, I've got my eye on you!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/05/02	I haven't given up on her! I'll save her!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/05/03	I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you. Not with all the soldiers around.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/05/04	Look! They tortured me! Mutilated!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/05/05	Bloody bastards! I hope they rot in the ground before all this is over.
Items/TradingItems/AmeliaHoodie_Name	Amelia's Hoodie
Items/TradingItems/AmeliaHoodie_Description	Well-worn and dirty, but it undoubtedly is Amelia's hoodie.
SpeechesCasual/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/01	The hoodie on that woman's bed looks familiar...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutWoman/00	Excuse me, where's the lady who was recently lying here?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutWoman/01	She died.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutWoman/02	What happened?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutWoman/03	We're undersupplied, and she was sick and wounded. The constant draught doesn't help either.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseAboutWoman/04	I'm sorry to hear that.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/DoctorSittingOnFloor/00	Such tragedy... I've lost my hospital... I've lost everything...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/DoctorSittingOnFloor/01	I was lucky, but my patients were not...
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/DoctorSittingOnFloor/02	*sigh*
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/DoctorSittingOnFloor/03	What am I supposed to do now...?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Doctor/AfterHelped/00	You... Thank you for saving my life.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Doctor/AfterHelped/01	I did what I had to. I'm looking for my daughter, Amelia. She was at your hospital.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/ToyStore_Doctor/AfterHelped/02	All the children from the hospital were sent to the church.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/FightWithBrother/00	My fool of a brother can get himself killed if he wants to, but I won't risk Amelia's life by carrying her through the middle of the warzone. We'll find the corridor when the worst fighting is over.
StateSpeeches/MoraleBio/WarStories_Story1/FoundNotesAboutChildsKidnapInSchool/00	Did someone kidnap Amelia to justify using the humanitarian corridor? If so, at least they won't hurt her, will they?
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/SoldierPatrolPoint/00	Can't wait till we liberate this city and go home.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/SoldierPatrolPoint/01	It's bloody business. We don't get paid enough.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/SoldierPatrolPoint/02	I wish I were somewhere else. Fucking insurgents.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/SoldierPatrolPoint/03	I hate guard duty.
LocationsTexts/WarStories/Story1/002_toystore/Investigation_item_04	An anonymous letter:

"I've got tipped that the soldiers aren't going to let anyone out of the city. The humanitarian corridor is a set up. They're going to kill everyone and blame it on the rebels. Warn whoever you can."
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseFirstMeet/00	Excuse me, I have a question...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseFirstMeet/01	Please come back later.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseFirstMeet/02	I'm the only nurse left after the bombing...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/NurseFirstMeet/03	I have to tend to this patient.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/Hospital/WomanHaveHoodieFirstMeet/04	Please, let me keep it. I'm very weak, even a minor infection can kill me.
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Hospital_Woman/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/02	It's so empty here after the bombing...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Hospital_Woman/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/00	I am so weak...
NPCSpeeches/LEVEL_SPECIFIC/WarStories/Story1/Hospital_Woman/NPCSpeeches/MeetNeutralAttitude/01	I would love to see my children one more time...
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/03/02	I haven't been here before, that must've been her captor!
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/03/03	Oh my, poor girl... I hope you find her.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/03/04	Do you know where he took her?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/018_hospital/03/05	No, I'm sorry. I really wish I could help you.

NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/LingSittingChairSoldier/Middle/Mid2/01	If I were in the high command, this war would long be over.

LocationsTexts/021_airport/Description_WS_Story1_before_memoryhole	I used to work at the airport before the war broke out. Now it's held by the military and off limits to civilians. I'd better keep away, unless I have no choice.
LocationsTexts/021_airport/Description_WS_Story1	The airport is currently held by the military and off limits to civilians. I don't think Amelia's there, but maybe I could get a gun from one of the soldiers... It's better to have one and not need it, than to need it and not have one.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/001E_cpn/01/00	Excuse me, I'm looking for my daughter. A tiny tween blonde. Have you seen her around?
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/001E_cpn/01/01	No, I'm certain I haven't seen her.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/001E_cpn/01/02	Are you sure? I thought someone might have brought her here.
Dialogues/WarStories/Story1/WhereIsAmelia/001E_cpn/01/03	I'm sure. But since you're here, we could trade - I have some really good stuff.
NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/SomeCasualScavenging/00	Let's see if I can find something interesting here.

NPCSpeeches/CasualActions/WarStories/SomeCasualScavenging/03	I miss my home.
LocationsTexts/WarStories/Story1/002_toystore/Story_item_01	There's a letter in doctor's gown's pocket:
